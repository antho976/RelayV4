//! `gym.*` — Avex, the person's gym app, in the Threads space (docs/GYM.md).
//!
//! The PC's copy is Avex's training history export, kept in its own SQLite file (`gym.db`) and
//! read only: an import replaces it whole. Its read shapes are `relay_gym`'s. Weights and volumes
//! are in the person's unit, the `unit` each reading names. Importing and forgetting emit
//! `gym.changed`, and are the person's alone; a thread's agent reads.
