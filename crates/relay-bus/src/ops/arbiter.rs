//! `arbiter.*` — Arbiter, rule-based crypto trading and AI trading research (docs/ARBITER.md).
//!
//! The book is its own SQLite file (`arbiter.db`); rules, the backtester and the risk gate are
//! `relay_arbiter`'s. Money and sizes are decimal strings in the product's quote currency. Every
//! change emits `arbiter.changed`.
//!
//! A thread's agent reaches the reads, `arbiter.backtest`, `arbiter.propose`, `arbiter.order.place`
//! and `arbiter.halt` (`threads::AGENT_OPS`); everything that saves a key, edits a strategy,
//! changes a limit, restarts after a halt or answers a proposal is the person's alone. An agent's
//! order goes through the same risk gate as a rule's, and outside "AI trades within limits" it
//! becomes a proposal instead of an order.
