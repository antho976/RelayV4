//! The reconcile pass's retention work (BUS.md §5.4, §10.2): soft-deleted rows are hard-deleted
//! once `undo.grace_days` has passed, and the notification and mailbox tables, which every agent
//! and guardrail writes into, are kept to a window instead of growing for the life of the store.
//!
//! [`run`] does only SQL, so it can run inside the request transaction. The files those rows
//! named (attachments, `.relay/trash/<id>/`) are returned for the caller to remove once the
//! transaction is gone — never under the store mutex.
