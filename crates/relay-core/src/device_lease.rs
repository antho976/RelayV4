//! Device leases: one holder per Android device at a time.
//!
//! Several agent sessions working on one app used to install over each other on the same phone —
//! one `gradlew installDebug` replacing the APK another session was halfway through testing, with
//! neither knowing the other existed. A lease makes the phone's current user visible and turns
//! the clobber into a typed refusal (`device.busy`) that names the holder, what it is doing and
//! since when, and says how to wait (`bus.wait` on `device.lease.released`).
//!
//! Three things take a lease:
//! - `device.run` — for as long as the run is live (building, installing, streaming logcat);
//! - an agent's own device-writing shell command (`adb install`, `adb shell am start`,
//!   `gradlew installDebug`, …), seen by the guardrail hook before it runs, and kept for a short
//!   grace period after it finishes so the agent can look at what it installed;
//! - `device.claim`, an explicit hold across several steps.
//!
//! Leases live in memory: a restart is a release, which is exactly right for a crash. A lease
//! also lapses with its run, its session's exit or close, or its own expiry. The map sits behind
//! its own small mutex and never touches SQLite, so taking one costs nothing in the store lock.
//!
//! One holder can hold several leases on one device — a claim, and the run it then starts — and
//! the strongest is the one others see. Ending the run leaves the claim in place.
