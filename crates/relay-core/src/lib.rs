//! RELAY v4 engine (BUS.md §5, §6): the store, the audit log, the request pipeline and the
//! socket door. `relay serve` runs exactly this, with or without a display; the native client
//! and the phone door are clients of its socket.

// `BusError` is ~250 bytes and is the *normal* path for typed refusals; boxing it in every
// handler signature would obscure the API for no measurable gain.
