//! Where a budget stands against an even spend. Port of `Pace.kt`.
//!
//! The app's one signature reading: "you have spent 62%" says nothing on its own, "$84 over pace
//! with 9 days left" says what to do. `elapsed_days` counts today, so on day 1 of a 31-day month
//! the pace already allows 1/31 of the budget: money spent today is spent today.
