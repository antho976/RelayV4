# Threads

Threads replace the Money space. A thread is a conversation with an agent that works on the data
of Antho's own apps, shown and editable beside it: agent first, data second. Tally's budget is the
first source and its investments the second; the gym app and an AI investing bot are later and not
designed here.

Decided with Antho on 2026-10-07:

- **Like the claude.ai website.** Native message bubbles, a thread list, a message box. Not a
  terminal. Many threads, each kept.
- **One app with Dev.** Threads is a space of the same window: the same title bar, sidebar,
  you-row, Settings, status bar, colours and fonts (`DESIGN.md`). Only the middle changes. The Money
  space's own warm palette goes.
- **No resending the whole conversation on every open.** Relay keeps its own copy of every
  message, so a thread reopens without the agent. While a thread is in use its agent keeps running;
  a cold thread is resumed once by Claude's own conversation id.
- **The agent may change the data, within limits.** It adds and edits entries freely, each with an
  Undo; deleting, budgets and accounts ask the person first.
- **Charts may use colour,** and the Tally panel's views may too. A chart stores its question, not
  its numbers, so it redraws when the phone syncs.

## Phases

1. **The thread engine** (built): `threads.db`, the `thread.*` ops, the background agent.
2. **The Threads space** in `relay-native` (built): thread list in the sidebar, the conversation,
   the message box, the Tally panel beside it, and Tally's pages restyled in Dev's tokens.
3. **Charts** (built): the agent writes a `chart` block, Relay draws it from the ledger and redraws
   it when the ledger moves. (The Undo card came with phase 2; pinning a chart to the panel is
   still to do.)
4. **Asking first:** a confirm card for what the agent may not do alone (delete, budgets,
   accounts), run as the person when they approve.
5. **Investments in Tally** (built in the PC's engine and for the agent; `docs/INVESTMENTS.md` is
   the contract): holdings and their value tracked in the ledger, on the phone and the PC in the
   same commit (`CLAUDE.md`: a money rule changes on both sides at once), and an agent that brings
   the person's Wealthsimple accounts in through the files Wealthsimple exports.

## The engine (phase 1)

`crates/relay-core/src/threads.rs`, ops in `crates/relay-bus/src/ops/thread.rs`.

**Storage.** `threads.db` beside the store (`money.db`'s neighbour), its own SQLite file behind its
own mutex: a `thread` row (title, provider, model, `agent_ref`) and its `message` rows. The store's
lock is never held for a thread, and the store's schema is untouched.

**Messages.** `role` is `user` (`{"text"}`), `assistant` (`{"blocks"}`, each a `text` or a
`tool_use` with its `id`, `name` and `input`), `tool` (`{"tool_use_id", "is_error", "text"}`) or
`error` (`{"text"}`). Claude's thinking is not kept.

**The agent.** Claude in print mode with stream-json in and out, started in `threads/` beside the
store (Claude files conversations by working directory, so a resume must start there):

```
claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose
       --include-partial-messages --strict-mcp-config --mcp-config <relay, as the person>
       --tools "" --allowedTools mcp__relay --setting-sources ""
       --append-system-prompt <what a thread is> [--model M] [--resume <agent_ref>]
```

- `--tools ""` removes every built-in tool: no shell, no files, no web. Verified with Claude Code
  2.1.293: the agent's tool list is only the MCP server's tools, and it may call them.
- The MCP server is Relay's own (`relay mcp`, acting as the person), under an agent whose
  environment sets `RELAY_MCP_OPS` to `threads::AGENT_OPS`. A thread has no session of its own, so
  the agent acts as the person, and the list is enforced twice: the MCP server lists and answers
  only those ops, and the socket door, which refuses the person's actor from any process the engine
  started (`peer.rs`), knows each running agent's pid and admits a process in that tree for those
  ops and `bus.ops` alone (`Peer::Thread`). Verified with real Claude (Haiku) against a disposable
  engine: it read the budget and a series through these tools and answered with a chart.
- The agent's start is checked: when Claude reports Relay's server missing, failed or with no
  tools, the thread says so in an error message instead of letting the agent answer from nothing.
- Each message is one stream-json line on the agent's stdin. Its stdout is read on a thread of its
  own: `thread.delta` events carry the reply as it is written, and each finished assistant message
  and tool answer is stored and announced with `thread.message`. Claude's `result` ends the turn.
- Spawning and writing to the agent happen after the handler returns, never under the store lock.
- One turn at a time: a message sent while the agent is answering is refused with `thread.busy`.
  `thread.stop` kills the agent's process group; the next message resumes it.
- An agent idle for 15 minutes is closed; at most four run at once, the one used longest ago closing
  first. An agent that exits mid-turn leaves an `error` message saying so, with its last stderr line.

**Ops.** `thread.list`, `thread.get` (messages after an id, for catching up), and, the person's
alone: `thread.create` (optionally with the first message, which also names the thread),
`thread.send`, `thread.stop`, `thread.rename`, `thread.delete`.

**Events.** `thread.changed` (`{"thread"}`, or `{"id", "deleted": true}`), `thread.message`
(`{"thread", "message"}`), `thread.delta` (`{"thread", "text"}`, not stored).

Tests: `crates/relay-core/tests/threads.rs` drives threads end to end against a stand-in Claude
that speaks the same stream-json.

## The Threads space (phase 2)

`apps/relay-native/src/threads_view.rs`, styled by `css/threads.css`; the space itself is still
`money.rs` (the switcher, the sidebar swap, the start screen), which now says Threads.

- **The sidebar** keeps Dev's frame and footer. Its keys are New thread (Ctrl N) and Tally, then
  the threads grouped Today, Yesterday, This week and Earlier, a green lamp on one at work.
- **The middle** is a new thread (greeting, the month in a line, the message box, four questions to
  start) or the open one: the person's messages as bubbles, the agent's Markdown drawn natively
  (`relay_client::thread_view`: paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, code), each tool call as a
  quiet line saying what it did, and an entry the agent added as a card with Undo
  (`money.tx.delete`). Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks the line; while the agent works the send key
  stops it.
- **The Tally panel** (the strip's right key hides it): Overview (what is left, budgets, recent
  entries), Entries (this month) and Budgets. Meters take the category's hue; amber is ahead of
  pace, red over budget.
- **Tally's pages** (Overview, Entries, Plan, Data) open from the sidebar's Tally key with their own
  tabs, in Dev's tokens (`css/money.css`); the Money space's warm palette is gone.

A display smoke run opens a thread with `RELAY_NATIVE_THREAD=<id>` beside `RELAY_NATIVE_PAGE=threads`.

## Charts (phase 3)

An agent asks for a chart by writing a fenced block with the language `chart` and one JSON object:

```chart
{"type": "bar", "title": "Groceries by week", "query": {"by": "week", "periods": 2, "category": "Groceries"}}
```

- `type` is `bar` (periods side by side), `line` (with `"cumulative": true` for pace) or `donut`
  (where the money went). `query` is a `money.series` payload; `data`
  (`{"labels", "series": [{"name", "values"}]}`, minor units) is accepted instead, for numbers that
  are not the ledger's, and is drawn as written.
- `money.series` (`crates/relay-money/src/series.rs`): `measure` spending, income or net; `by`
  category (the largest seven and Other, in their category colours), week, day or period; `periods`
  how many budget periods end at `period_offset`; `category` by name. A period still running says
  how far it has got (`known`), so a running total stops at today. It is a reading for the PC, not a
  money rule, so it has no Kotlin twin.
- The card (`apps/relay-native/src/threads_chart.rs`) reads its numbers when drawn and again on every
  `money.changed`. Colour is the data's: the newest period in Relay's lime, earlier ones in blue,
  orange and on; hovering a group gives its values. Labels and axis are Dev's type.

## Model and effort, and the Tally pages (2026-10-08)

- **Each thread picks its model and effort** in the message box (Default, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5,
  Haiku 5.5, Fable 5.1; effort Default, Low to Max). `thread.set` stores them (`threads.db`
  version 2 adds `effort`) and closes a running agent, so the next message resumes the same
  conversation with `--model` and `--effort`. A new thread starts with the last choice.
- **Tally's pages are dense:** each opens on a strip of figures (Overview: left to spend, spent,
  income, net worth and the pace; Entries: count, in, out, net; Plan: monthly budget, given to
  categories, unassigned, spent), then cards of compact rows with category badges and icons.
  Overview fits budgets, bills and recent entries on one screen; Entries groups days with their net;
  Plan is one table; Data is a two-column settings list.
- **The sidebar and the Tally panel can be dragged** wider or narrower (sidebar 200 to 420 pixels;
  the panel opens at 340).

## Investments (phase 5)

`docs/INVESTMENTS.md` is the contract: the ledger's new tables, the rules both devices read them by,
the Wealthsimple files and the ops. This is what the PC's engine and the agent do with them.

- **Ops** (`crates/relay-bus/src/ops/money.rs`, handlers in `crates/relay-core/src/handlers/money.rs`):
  `money.invest.summary` (the portfolio reading) and `money.invest.list` (activities, newest first)
  are unlocked queries. `money.invest.add`, `money.invest.delete`, `money.invest.restore`,
  `money.invest.room`, `money.invest.price`, `money.fx.set`, `money.value.set` and
  `money.account.update` are short ledger writes, and `money.account.add` takes a `registration` and
  an `institution`. Every mutation emits `money.changed`.
- **Files are the person's.** `money.invest.preview` (an unlocked query) and `money.invest.import`
  (staged: the file is read before the transaction opens) are `UserOnly` and take an absolute path
  to a Wealthsimple holdings report, activities export or monthly statement. An import writes rows
  under derived uids, so the same file imported twice, or on the phone and here, adds its lines once.
- **Rates from the Bank of Canada.** `money.fx.fetch` (`UserOnly`) answers `{started}` at once, as
  `github.connect` does. After the transaction a thread of its own runs `curl` under a 15-second
  deadline against Valet's `FXUSDCAD` series (no key; the request carries nothing about the person),
  writes the last ten business days' rates as `BANK_OF_CANADA`, and emits `money.changed` with
  `{"fx": n}`, or `{"fx": 0, "error"}` when it failed. A fetch asked for while one runs answers
  `started: false`.
- **The agent** may call `money.invest.summary`, `money.invest.list` and `money.invest.add`
  (`AGENT_OPS`). Its prompt gives it the units (units held and prices at 1e-8, gains in basis
  points), tells it to read the summary first, to say the as-of date and that a return is
  money-weighted, and to leave arithmetic to the tools; walks it through Wealthsimple's Documents
  menu for the holdings report and the activities export; and keeps it safe: it never takes a
  password, a two-factor code or a key, only `my.wealthsimple.com` is Wealthsimple, and a live
  connection (SnapTrade, the unofficial API) is not built. Importing, deleting, room, prices and
  rates stay the person's.
- **The import card.** The agent asks for a file with a fenced `import` block:

  ```import
  {"source": "wealthsimple", "expects": "holdings", "title": "Your holdings report"}
  ```

  `relay_client::thread_view::import_spec` reads it (`source` must be `wealthsimple`; `expects` is
  `holdings`, `activities` or `statement`). The card lets the person choose or drop the file,
  previews it (`money.invest.preview`), maps its accounts and imports it; the person's next message
  says what came in. An activity the agent records is a card with Undo (`money.invest.delete`).

Tests: `crates/relay-core/tests/money.rs` imports the shared holdings report (W1) through the bus
twice and reads it back, records, undoes and restores an activity, refuses files and the network to
an agent, and fetches rates from a stand-in `curl`; `crates/relay-remote/tests/remote.rs` carries an
imported activity from the phone through `money.sync`.
