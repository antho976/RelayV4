/**
 * Writes every auto-posting bill that has come due into the ledger, catching up on any days the
 * app was not opened. Runs at launch and from the daily worker; the mutex and the per-bill
 * transaction mean two overlapping runs can never post the same date twice.
 *
 * It also moves reminders on. A reminder never writes an entry, and Tally cannot see whether you
 * paid it, so its date is a heads-up rather than a debt: it shows ahead of time on Home and in
 * Plan, and on the day itself, and once that day is over it moves to its next date, as a bill
 * that posts itself does, only without the entry. Left in place, a paid reminder would read as
 * overdue for months and count every month since in what is due.
