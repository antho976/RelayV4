# Design System: Relay native

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Multiviewer"**

Relay is a compact console surrounding a wall of agent terminals. Screen-black
plates, narrow gutters and persistent top identity strips make sessions
readable at a glance. In Operate mode, terminal work and attention states lead.

Visual authority is Relay-2 at `1745dd3f68b7bc786f48142ad7da591537aeb057`, especially
its `theme.ts`, `TerminalPane.svelte`, `AgentsWall.svelte`, `Icon.svelte` and
shell components. Rendered component anatomy takes precedence over stale prose. The user
explicitly requested this identity and layout; V3's UI is not the reference.
The native theme lives in `apps/relay-native/src/theme.css`, with runtime palette
and wallpaper application in `shell.rs`. This records the implemented GTK4
surfaces; it does not certify complete feature parity, visual fidelity or device
runtime behavior. Validation and remaining coverage belong in
`docs/VERIFICATION.md` and `docs/PARITY.md`.

**The 2026-10 rework (Antho's mockup and token sheet).** Everything around the terminals is
warm near-black chrome in Geist: rounded keys, fields and rows (10px), pills for small toggles,
a search-field palette key with a Ctrl K keycap, the ring mark and Sora wordmark, a segmented
view switch and a mono status bar. **The terminal panes are not part of it.** Their plates,
identity strips, lamps, metadata, gutters, Fira faces and screen colour stay exactly as below;
Antho asked for them to be left alone. The Dashboard page was removed at the same time.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Screen-black square plates with top session identity strips (unchanged).
- Warm near-black chrome, off-white primary keys and state color only where it means state.
- Geist for the interface, Geist Mono for figures, keycaps and code, Sora for the wordmark,
  Fira Mono (and Fira in the pane strips) for the terminals.
- Native GTK controls, VTE terminals and GtkSourceView source editing.
- Sidebar navigation, worktree tools and persistent note tabs/satellites.
- Matte, Dark and OLED palettes with optional wallpaper controls.

## Colors

Frontmatter records the default Matte palette; names below describe its roles.
Dark and OLED modes replace the neutral palette through the same semantic roles.
Live and held colors retain their meanings in every mode.

### Primary
- **Lit Ink** (`ink`): primary text and primary action fill.
  Primary keys use `wall` text and brighten to white on hover.

### Secondary
- **Live Green** (`live`): running session lamp.
- **Attention Red** (`held`): held session lamp and session name;
  also the notice underline.
- **Waiting Amber** (`waiting`): waiting states. Starting and restorable session
  lamps, the mirror's waiting lamp, review and pending markers, unsaved notes and
  the guardrail prompt's top rule use it. All terminal frames remain neutral.

### Neutral
The sheet's names, and the CSS token each one is (`theme.css`; the first ten change per mode
through `fonts::PALETTES`, Dark being the sheet itself, Matte a step lighter, OLED on black):
- **Ground** `@wall`/`@console`: app background, bars, sidebar. **Surface** `@slab`: keys,
  cards, pills, popovers. **Selected** `@wash`: hover and selected rows. **Raised** `@raised`:
  fields and the search key. **Track** `@track`: bar tracks, the lit segment, the avatar.
- **Lines**: `@line_subtle`, `@edge` (line), `@strong` (line-strong), `@line_emphasis` (keycaps),
  `@line_focus` (focused fields).
- **Inks**: `@ink`, `@secondary` (ink-2), `@faint` (ink-3), `@ink_dim`.
- **Screen** `@screen`: the terminals and the code editor only, at each mode's earlier value.
  The terminal strips draw with the mode tokens as before.

**The Tally Rule.** Chrome color communicates state. Primary actions stay off-white; ANSI and syntax colors remain inside their content surfaces.

## Typography

Geist carries the interface (13px controls and rows, 14px nav and body, 12px captions; 400,
500 for buttons and toggles, 600 for names and the primary key). Geist Mono carries figures,
keycaps, paths and the status bar (11.5px). Sora 600 is the wordmark only: "relay" at 17px in
the title bar, 46px on the start screen. All four are bundled (`resources/fonts`, SIL OFL) and
registered for Relay alone. VTE requests Fira Mono at 10pt by default, adjustable from 8pt to
24pt in Settings, and the terminal strips keep Fira Sans and Fira Sans Condensed. These are
Pango point sizes, not CSS pixels. GTK owns scaling and metrics.

Section labels in the sidebar read in sentence case ("Workspaces"). Session names are 13px
semibold. The Code editor's GtkSourceView sets Geist Mono at 12.5px
(`.code-source`) and the bundled Relay scheme (`resources/relay-editor.xml`,
Relay-2's syntax colours over Adwaita-dark), installed as `relay-matte`,
`relay-dark` and `relay-oled` with each mode's background.

## Layout

The sidebar requests 248px. The top bar has a 52px minimum height, the status
line 30px and toolbars 38px; native theme metrics can increase these minimums.
Task and module details occupy the content page. The command palette is centered
inside the app and window presets open below the title bar. Only Notes and the
emulator use separate app windows.

The default window is 1440 by 900. Pages and the right-side launch sheet use
20px insets; the sheet overlays the wall at 780px including its insets. It does not shrink
the terminal wall. A scrim blocks background actions and Escape dismisses an idle sheet.

Navigation lives in the sidebar (Board, Skills, Plugins, Notes), followed by projects grouped
under workspaces. The footer is you: an initial in a round avatar, your first name and the gear
that opens Settings. The top bar carries identity and utility controls,
without a second row of page tabs. The bottom status bar exposes resource and
device tools.

Grid mode uses square terminal plates with 2px gutters and one, two or three
columns. The two-column wall has a draggable divider. Focus shows one session
with session tabs; Review places the focused session beside the remaining
stack. Plates request at least 280 by 280 and the wall scrolls vertically.
Sessions can be reordered or focused within the wall. Layout selection, order
and split position can be saved. There are no automatic mobile breakpoints.

Code uses resizable file-tree, editor and Git regions with a worktree selector.
Its tree split starts at 240px; file and Git regions can be hidden. Notes uses a
list beside a scrollable native tab strip and editor. Tabs identify project and
note, can reorder, and can open in separate windows.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth comes from tonal surface steps and thin dividers. Custom buttons and the
titlebar suppress shadows. Compact in-app panels use a thin edge and a restrained
shadow; OS file choosers keep their native decoration. Launch reveal duration is zero and VTE cursor blinking is off.

Optional PNG/JPEG wallpaper fills the window with cover sizing, beneath a black
dim layer. Settings exposes a wallpaper library, panel opacity, wallpaper dim
and content contrast. Increasing content contrast raises effective panel
opacity. The top bar sits inside the wallpaper backdrop like the status bar, so
both chrome strips show it through one console layer. Terminal plates follow
panel opacity too, as one slightly denser layer (`@plate`, about 5 points above
the chrome) over the page; VTE's own ground is clear, and a parked session's
slate hides its stale screen. The workspace strip above the wall adds no layer
of its own. Text-entry grounds remain opaque for legibility. The Matte default
uses fully opaque panels, which keeps the screen-black plates.

The status bar's usage meters show, per enabled provider, the 5-hour, weekly
and Fable windows chosen in the limits popup, with amber at 70% and red at 90%,
and faint once a window has reset since its report. Beside them sit when the
limits were last read and a refresh key.

## Shapes

Keys, entries, navigation and project rows use the 10px radius; icon keys 7px; popovers 12px;
panels, sheets and cards 14px; small toggles, switches and badges are pills. Terminal plates and
their strips stay square. Terminal boundaries and strip separators are neutral 1px strokes
in every session state. Live and held lamps carry the tally color; held session
names also turn red.

## Components

### Buttons
Keys have a 28px minimum height (the title bar's 34px). Ordinary keys use surface with a
line-strong stroke, the primary key ("New agent") uses ink with ground text, and quiet keys are
transparent with ink-2 text. Hover uses wash except for
primary keys, which brighten to white. Keyboard focus draws a 2px outline of ink
at 35% alpha just outside the key (`outline-offset: 0`). Disabled keys use 40%
opacity; a few compact controls dim further or less (0.32 to 0.55).

### Inputs / Fields
Entries use raised fill, a line-strong stroke, a 10px radius and a 30px minimum height. Focus
moves the stroke to line-focus with a faint ink ring. The palette key is drawn as a search
field: glass, "Search or run a command", and a Ctrl K keycap. Native text views have 8px padding and ink carets.
GTK supplies editing, selection and accessibility semantics.

### Navigation
Sidebar navigation (36px rows) selects with the selected fill and ink. Project rows have a 34px
minimum height and select with the selected fill, no rail; counts are plain Geist Mono. Above
the wall, the project crumb is a surface pill and Agents, Editor, Files and Git are one
segmented control whose showing view is lit with track. Focus-session tabs use
neutral wash for selection. The main window draws its own minimize, maximize
and close keys in the top bar (`.window-control`: transparent, wash on hover,
held red when hovering close). The Notes window styles its own titlebar
controls, menu bar and popover menus (`css/notes.css`), and the sidebar row,
board, Git and branch menus carry their own popover styling.

### Icons
`apps/relay-native/src/icons.rs` carries the pinned Relay-2 SVG path geometry.
Shared shell/action icons use a 16-unit view box, 1.5-unit strokes and rounded
stroke caps and joins, rendered by GTK's SVG paintable. Preserve that geometry
when adding native controls. File-type glyphs in the explorer and Git panel are the
one exception to neutral chrome: like syntax colour, they describe content, so each
carries a muted per-language tint (`css/git_files.css`), and Git status letters use
VS Code's status colours. Native widget fallback icons remain GTK-owned;
matching path geometry alone is not proof of complete rendering fidelity.

### Records / Containers
Records are flat square slabs with 12px padding. Board lanes use console fill
and 8px padding. Notices use slab, ink and an attention-colored bottom rule.

### Terminal plate
VTE owns rendering and scrolling. Terminal margins are 10px left, 2px right,
8px top and 4px bottom. The top identity strip uses console fill, 8px side
padding and a 26px minimum height, with a neutral bottom separator. A colored
lamp leads the session name, provider/role metadata, state and compact actions.
Session names ellipsize in the middle. Identity remains visible while terminals are
busy. VTE supports Ctrl+Shift+C/V, preserves scroll position on output and
scrolls on keystrokes.

### Code and notes
GtkSourceView provides the Code gutter, highlighting, find/replace and native
text editing. Worktree selection scopes the file tree, content search, file
operations and Git controls. Read-only comparisons sit beside editable source;
staging, commits, history and branch tools stay in the Git region.

Notes is a desktop text editor in the KWrite mould, in its own window. Its compact
titlebar carries a File/Edit/Search/View menu bar (menus show their shortcuts)
and the open note's name; below it sit a toolbar, a resizable library (search,
pinned and dated rows, sort, a context menu) and tabbed GtkSourceView documents
with Markdown highlighting and list continuation. A find/replace bar (match case,
whole words, regular expressions, "3 of 12"), go-to-line and a status bar (save
state, line and column, counts, Markdown/plain, encoding, line endings, zoom,
autosave) complete each document. Open drafts remain mounted in tabs, and each
project's open tabs are restored. Saving is explicit by default: unsaved tabs show
a dot and closing one asks Save / Don't Save / Cancel. Autosave is an opt-in
preference that saves through the same conflict-checked update after a pause and
when the window hides. A change made elsewhere reloads a clean tab and raises a
notice on a dirty one. Plan uses the same editor with its title fixed. Preserve
project identity when a tab outlives navigation.

### Native adaptations
Mail composition remains mounted while messages refresh. Message/error text is
selectable. Approval controls distinguish task approval from permission to
execute a held action. Task details, skills, settings, launch profiles and
device tooling use native controls. Imported roadmap documents are future
requirements, not evidence that every corresponding surface is complete.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- Do preserve the square terminal plate anatomy; the warm rework stops at its edge.
- Do keep session identity visible above terminal content in its top strip.
- Do use off-white primary keys and state color only where it has meaning.
- Do preserve native keyboard focus, selection and clipboard behavior.

### Don't:
- Don't add decorative accent colors or idle animation; pills are for small toggles and
  badges only. The
  guardrail prompt is the deliberate exception: as the one floating surface it is
  rounded (10px card, 6px keys, round icon and "more" keys), shadowed and fades
  in and out (`css/guardrails.css`). The adb lease card (8px) and the mirror's
  device screen (12px) are rounded too.
- Don't copy web layout rules into GTK without checking native behavior.
- Don't treat imported roadmap surfaces as implemented UI.
- Don't claim full parity, sustained performance or complete accessibility from screenshots alone.
