# Animation for games

You cannot watch an animation. You write keys with bpy, then measure them with
`blender_anim_inspect` and look at still frames with `blender_render`. Load
`blender-fundamentals` first (bpy, context, files) and `blender-rigging` for the skeleton, props
and constraints. Verified snippets are in
[reference/animation-recipes.md](reference/animation-recipes.md) - read it before writing
keyframe, loop, bake, root-motion or partner code. After import, `unreal-animation-verification`
repeats these checks in Unreal (`ue_anim_inspect`, `ue_anim_preview`); `unreal-animation` covers
Animation Blueprints, montages, root motion settings and the IK Retargeter; `blender-to-unreal`
covers the export itself.

Hard rule: **never report an animation as done until `blender_anim_inspect` passes for it (with
the grips, partner and contacts of the move) and you have looked at `blender_render` images at
its key frames.** If a check cannot run, say the result is unverified.

## 1. Organisation

- **One action per move**, named `A_<Char>_<Move>` (`A_Hero_Walk`, `A_Hero_Punch_L`,
  `A_Hero_HitReact_Front`). Unreal imports each as an AnimSequence; check the imported names
  (`blender_to_unreal` takes `name`).
- **Fake user on every action** (`act.use_fake_user = True`). An action with no user is deleted
  when the file is saved and reopened.
- **Manual frame range** (`act.use_frame_range = True`, `frame_start`, `frame_end`). The exporter
  (all-actions mode), `blender_anim_inspect` sampling and loop checks use `act.frame_range`,
  which is the key range unless the manual range is on.
- **Frame rate: 30 fps** unless the project says otherwise (`scene.render.fps = 30`,
  `fps_base = 1`). Blender's factory default is 24; `blender_info` shows the file's rate. Set it
  before keying - changing fps later does not move keys. Unreal uses the file's rate on import
  unless its "use default sample rate" option is on.
- **Start every action from the rest pose.** Bones without keys in the new action keep whatever
  pose the previous action left; reset `matrix_basis` for all pose bones when you create or
  switch actions (recipe 2 does).
- **NLA is for authoring only** (layering, previewing a sequence). The exporter is run with NLA
  strips off; what exports is each action. Do not leave an action only in an NLA strip: push-down
  unassigns it, and a strip in tweak mode blocks reassigning the active action.
- One armature per character, many actions. Two characters in one file each get their own
  actions (section 6).
- **Blender 4.4+ (slotted actions):** an action has slots; `action.fcurves` is a legacy view that
  works for single-slot actions and is removed in 5.0. `pose_bone.keyframe_insert(...)` works in
  every version - prefer it where speed does not matter, and after assigning an action by code
  check `obj.animation_data.action_slot` on those versions. Verify with `dir()` before relying
  on either API.

## 2. Keyframing from Python

- Key pose bones with `pb.keyframe_insert("rotation_quaternion", frame=f, group=pb.name)` and
  `pb.keyframe_insert("location", ...)`. Use quaternions for bones (no gimbal lock, and what the
  exporter bakes anyway); call `q.make_compatible(previous)` before keying so consecutive keys
  take the short path.
- Pose values are in the **bone's local rest axes**: Y runs along the bone, Z is set by roll.
  "Rotate the arm forward" is a different axis for each bone; test one key and measure with
  `blender_anim_inspect track` before writing a whole move.
- For hundreds of keys, write F-curves directly (`act.fcurves.new(data_path, index=i,
  action_group=bone)`, `keyframe_points.add(n)`, `foreach_set("co", ...)`, then `fc.update()`).
- Interpolation per key: `BEZIER` with `AUTO_CLAMPED` handles for organic motion, `LINEAR` for
  root travel and mechanical parts, `CONSTANT` for stepped holds and switches (Child Of
  influence, visibility).
- Loops: first key equals last key on every channel, `act.use_cyclic = True` (cyclic-aware auto
  handles across the seam), and optionally a `CYCLES` F-curve modifier so the preview repeats.
  The FBX export bakes only the frame range, so modifiers never replace real keys.

## 3. Root motion or in-place

| | Root motion | In-place |
|---|---|---|
| What moves the character | The `root` bone's keys; Unreal moves the capsule from them (Enable Root Motion on the sequence) | Gameplay moves the capsule; the clip stays at the origin |
| Use for | Attacks with lunges, vaults, climbs, paired moves, anything whose travel must match the art exactly | Locomotion driven by input and blend spaces (the usual choice for walk/run) |
| Authoring | Animate `root` on the ground plane (x, y, yaw); keep `pelvis` relative to it | `root` stays at zero; `pelvis` bobs and sways relative to it |
| Check | Planted feet do not move in world space | Planted feet move backward at exactly the gameplay speed |

- `root` never carries height bob, lean or anything that is not the character's travel.
- Mocap and Mixamo-style data carry travel in the hips; move the ground-plane part onto `root`
  (recipe 5) or delete it for in-place.
- Record the speed (distance per cycle / cycle duration) and hand it to gameplay: a walk authored
  at 1.4 m/s played at 2.0 m/s slides.

## 4. Timing and spacing for games

Readable, responsive motion beats realism. At 30 fps:

- **Anticipation -> action -> contact -> recovery.** A light attack: 3-6 frames anticipation,
  1-3 frames to contact, 1-2 frames of contact, 8-15 frames recovery. Heavy attacks double the
  anticipation and recovery. Startup frames are gameplay: agree them with the designer; mark
  the active window for a notify (hit on/off frames).
- **Holds**: 2-4 frames on the key pose (strike, landing) so it reads at gameplay distance.
- **Spacing**: fast in the middle, slow into and out of key poses (ease); snappy attacks ease out
  hard from anticipation and ease into the hold.
- **Overlap and follow-through**: secondary parts (head, hands, tails, cloth bones) lag the
  driver by 1-3 frames and settle after it stops.
- **Weight**: heavier characters and objects take longer to start and stop; the pelvis dips on
  landing and contact.
- **Cycles**: walk ~30-36 frames per cycle (two steps), run ~18-24. Each step has contact, down,
  passing and up poses at roughly its quarters.
- **Hit reactions** start on the impact frame or one after, never before.

## 5. Props in animation

- The prop's pivot is its grip; it is parented to the hand bone, or held by a Child Of
  constraint while it changes hands (`blender-rigging`, reference/rigging-recipes.md recipe 8:
  pick-up at one frame, drop at another, no jump at either switch). Key the Child Of influence
  with `CONSTANT` interpolation.
- Throws: Child Of influence 1 -> 0 at the release frame, the prop's own keys (ballistic arc)
  after. In Unreal this becomes a detach at a notify plus a projectile; keep the release frame
  and the hand velocity in the notes.
- Props are not in skeletal exports. They ship as static meshes and attach to sockets in Unreal;
  the Blender animation is for authoring and checking the hand path.
- Check every held item with `blender_anim_inspect attachments` (grips within tolerance, `side`
  correct, clearance to the own body).

## 6. Two-character interactions

Author both characters in **one file on one timeline**, so contacts can be measured:

1. Both rigs in the file, each with its own action, same frame range and the same start frame.
2. Place them by their **object transforms** (roots at their own origins in their own actions),
   facing each other with the exact distance and angle the game will use. Recipe 7 slides the
   partner so the planned contact lands; record the resulting root distance and yaw - gameplay
   (or a motion-warping / contextual-animation setup in Unreal) must reproduce it.
3. Key the shared events on the same frames (impact, grab, release). Reactions start on the
   impact frame or later.
4. Check with `blender_anim_inspect` using `partner: {armature, action}` and `contacts`:
   ```
   blender_anim_inspect {file, armature: "Hero", action: "A_Hero_Punch", frames: [1, 8, 12, 13, 16, 24, 30],
     track: ["hand.R:tail", "partner:head"],
     partner: {armature: "Partner", action: "A_Partner_HitReact"},
     contacts: [{a: "hand.R:tail", b: "partner:head", expect: "touch", distance: 6, window: [12, 12]},
                {a: "hand.R:tail", b: "partner:head", expect: "apart", distance: 15, window: [1, 8]}]}
   ```
   Keep contact windows tight: a punch touches for 1-2 frames. In testing (recipe 7), this call
   passed with a 3 cm contact at frame 12; widening the window to [12, 16] failed at 13 and 16
   because the partner correctly recoils from frame 12 while the fist holds - fix the window,
   not the reaction. Always include the contact frames in `frames`. Any `partner_clipping`
   outside a contact is a real problem.
5. Export each character's action separately (section 9 - all-actions would mix them).

## 7. Retargeting mocap and Mixamo-style clips

Be honest: Blender has no built-in retargeter.

- **Best**: import the source clip into Unreal on its own skeleton and retarget there with the
  IK Retargeter (IK Rigs with matching chains, retarget pose to reconcile T- vs A-pose). See
  `unreal-animation`.
- **In Blender**: third-party add-ons exist; they are not bundled, so the user must install
  them. For rigs with the same bone names and rest orientations, recipe 9 (Copy Rotation per bone
  plus hips location, then bake) works.
- Before anything: compare names (`mixamorig:Hips` style prefixes), rest pose (T vs A), scale
  (clips often import with a 0.01 or 100 object scale - apply it), root (many clips have no
  `root`; the hips carry travel - recipe 5), and fps.
- After: feet (recipe 8), hands and props (`blender_anim_inspect`), and renders at key frames.

## 8. Foot contact and sliding

- Planted feet should stay put (root motion) or move at the capsule speed (in-place). Recipe 8
  prints height and slide per frame for a foot bone.
- `blender_anim_inspect` reports `feet_height` per sample and a `ground` problem when a foot is
  more than 2 cm below the rest-pose ground; add `track: ["foot.L", "foot.R"]` with explicit
  `frames` over a contact to read positions.
- Fix sliding by keying the foot with IK (target empty fixed during the contact) and baking
  (recipe 6), or by correcting root speed - not by nudging single frames.

## 9. Bake, then export

The FBX exporter samples the evaluated pose, so constraints driven by the same armature export
correctly for the current action. **Bake to keys** (recipe 6: `bpy.ops.nla.bake` with
`visual_keying=True`) when:
- constraint targets are other objects (IK empties, a partner, a prop) - their animation is not
  switched with the action;
- you export several actions from one file;
- a control rig drives an export skeleton (Rigify: `blender-rigging`
  reference/rigify-game-skeleton.md);
- twist bones or correctives are driven by constraints (they do not exist in Unreal).

Export:
- `blender_export {file, objects: ["Hero"], kind: "animation", action: "A_Hero_Walk", path}` -
  one action; the timeline is set to its range. For a skeleton that already exists in Unreal,
  `blender_to_unreal {kind: "animation", action, skeleton: "/Game/.../SK_Hero_Skeleton", destination}`.
- `all_actions: true` exports **every action whose F-curve paths resolve on the armature** - one
  take per action, named `<Armature>|<Action>`. Verified: that includes another character's
  action with the same bone names and even an IK empty's object action (`location` resolves on
  any object). Use it only in a file that holds just this character's clean actions; otherwise
  export per action.
- Skeletal exports carry deform bones only; control bones' motion must already be on deform
  bones (baked).

## 10. Verify your work

For every action, before export:

1. `blender_info {file}`: fps, action list with ranges and fake users.
2. Recipe 1: action ranges, `use_frame_range`, which actions fit which rig.
3. `blender_anim_inspect {file, armature, action, samples: 9}` - no problems. Add `track` for the
   hands, feet and props; `attachments` with `grips` for held items; `partner` and `contacts` for
   interactions.
4. Loops: recipe 4's seam check, and `blender_anim_inspect frames: [first, last]` - tracked
   positions equal (in-place) or offset by exactly one cycle's travel (root motion).
5. Feet: recipe 8 over each contact.
6. `blender_render {file, objects, action, frames: [key frames], views: ["front", "right"]}` -
   look at anticipation, contact, extreme and recovery poses. Front views mirror: the character's
   right hand appears on the image's left; trust `side` from `blender_anim_inspect`, not the image.
7. After import, `unreal-animation-verification` in Unreal.
8. Report: actions and ranges, fps, speeds for locomotion, contact frames and distances, the
   images you looked at, and the .blend files you changed.
