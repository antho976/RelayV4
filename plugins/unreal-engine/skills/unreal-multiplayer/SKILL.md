# Unreal Multiplayer and Replication

Unreal networking is **server-authoritative client-server**. One server (dedicated, or a
listen server that is also a player) owns the true game state; clients send input/requests
and receive replicated state. There is no peer-to-peer gameplay and no automatic lockstep.

Read `reference/replication-cookbook.md` for copy-ready patterns (health with OnRep, fire
RPC, multicast cosmetics, owner-only data, FastArray inventory, push model, dormancy,
subobjects, CharacterMovement custom flags). Related: `unreal-gas` (ability replication),
`unreal-gameplay-framework` (GameMode/GameState/PlayerState/Controller - which exist where),
`unreal-cpp`, `unreal-build-packaging` (packaging server and client builds).

## Where things exist

| Class | Server | Owning client | Other clients |
|---|---|---|---|
| GameMode | yes | no | no |
| GameState | yes | yes | yes |
| PlayerController | yes | own only | no |
| PlayerState | yes | yes (all) | yes (all) |
| Pawn/Character | yes | yes | yes (if relevant) |
| HUD / UMG widgets | no (unless listen host) | own only | no |

Consequences: never read `GetGameMode()` on a client (null). Put shared match state in
GameState, per-player public state in PlayerState, private per-player state on the
PlayerController or with `COND_OwnerOnly`.

## Authority and roles

- `HasAuthority()` - true on the machine that owns the authoritative copy (server for
  replicated actors; also true on clients for actors they spawned locally that are not replicated).
- `GetLocalRole()`: `ROLE_Authority`, `ROLE_AutonomousProxy` (the locally controlled pawn on
  its owning client), `ROLE_SimulatedProxy` (everyone else's view). `GetRemoteRole()` is the other side.
- `IsLocallyControlled()` (Pawn) / `IsLocalController()` - "is this my player on this
  machine". Use for camera, input, UI, first-person meshes.
- `GetNetMode()`: `NM_Standalone`, `NM_DedicatedServer`, `NM_ListenServer`, `NM_Client`.
  `IsNetMode(NM_DedicatedServer)` to skip cosmetics on a dedicated server.
- Rule: gameplay state changes happen only where `HasAuthority()` is true. Clients request
  changes with Server RPCs.

## Property replication

1. Actor replicates: `bReplicates = true;` in the constructor (or `SetReplicates(true)` at
   runtime on the server). Components: `SetIsReplicatedByDefault(true)` in the component
   constructor, or `SetIsReplicated(true)`.
2. Mark properties:
   ```cpp
   UPROPERTY(Replicated) int32 Ammo;
   UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing = OnRep_Health) float Health;
   UFUNCTION() void OnRep_Health(float OldHealth);  // old-value param is optional
   ```
3. Register them:
   ```cpp
   #include "Net/UnrealNetwork.h"
   void AMyActor::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const
   {
       Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(OutLifetimeProps);
       DOREPLIFETIME(AMyActor, Health);
       DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(AMyActor, Ammo, COND_OwnerOnly);
   }
   ```
   Forgetting `Super::` breaks replication of base-class properties (including movement).
   A `Replicated` property not registered here triggers an assert/error in the log.

Facts that bite:
- Replication is **server -> client only**, and only for changed values, at the actor's
  update rate. Clients setting a replicated property only change their local copy.
- `OnRep_` functions run **only on clients** in C++. On a listen server, call the handler
  manually after setting the value if the host needs the same reaction. (Blueprint RepNotify
  also fires on the server; C++ does not.)
- Order of property arrival across different actors is not guaranteed. An OnRep can run
  before BeginPlay or before a referenced actor has replicated (pointer is null, arrives later).
- Only the latest value is sent; intermediate values are lost. Do not use replicated
  properties as event queues - use a counter, a FastArray, or an RPC.
- Replicated `UObject*` references only resolve if the referenced object is itself
  replicated or is a stably-named asset/level object.

Conditions (`ELifetimeCondition`): `COND_None`, `COND_InitialOnly`, `COND_OwnerOnly`,
`COND_SkipOwner`, `COND_SimulatedOnly`, `COND_AutonomousOnly`, `COND_SimulatedOrPhysics`,
`COND_InitialOrOwner`, `COND_Custom` (toggle with `DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE` in
`PreReplication`), `COND_Never`. RepNotify policy: `DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION_NOTIFY(C, P, COND_None, REPNOTIFY_Always)`
fires OnRep even when the value did not change (needed for predicted values).

## RPCs

```cpp
UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable, WithValidation) void ServerFire(FVector_NetQuantize Origin, FVector_NetQuantizeNormal Dir);
UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable)                 void ClientShowHitMarker();
UFUNCTION(NetMulticast, Unreliable)         void MulticastPlayImpact(FVector_NetQuantize Location);
```
Implement `ServerFire_Implementation(...)`, and `bool ServerFire_Validate(...)` when
`WithValidation` is present (returning false disconnects the client - use only for cheating,
not for gameplay "cannot fire now" checks). `WithValidation` is optional in UE5.

| Called on | Server RPC | Client RPC | NetMulticast |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server | runs on server | runs on owning client | runs on server + all relevant clients |
| Owning client | runs on server | runs locally | runs locally only |
| Non-owning client | **dropped** | runs locally | runs locally only |

- A client can only call Server RPCs on actors **its connection owns**: its PlayerController,
  its possessed Pawn, its PlayerState, and actors whose Owner chain leads to its
  PlayerController (`SetOwner(PC)` on the server). Calling a Server RPC on a world actor (a
  door) from a client silently does nothing - route it through the Pawn/Controller.
- Reliable: guaranteed, ordered; overuse saturates the reliable buffer and disconnects the
  client. Use for rare, important events (fire request, purchase, chat). Never call a
  Reliable RPC every Tick.
- Unreliable: may drop; use for frequent cosmetic/transient data.
- Multicast is for one-off cosmetic events to relevant clients. Late joiners and clients
  that become relevant later do **not** receive it - persistent state must be a replicated property.
- RPC params are value-serialized; keep them small (use `FVector_NetQuantize*`, bytes, tags).

## Ownership and relevancy

- Owner set by `SetOwner()` on the server, or via `SpawnActor` params (`Params.Owner`).
  Possession sets the Pawn's owner to the Controller.
- Relevancy decides whether an actor replicates to a connection at all: by default distance
  (`NetCullDistanceSquared`, default 225,000,000 = 150 m), plus `bAlwaysRelevant`,
  `bOnlyRelevantToOwner`, `bNetUseOwnerRelevancy`, or override `IsNetRelevantFor`.
- When a spawned actor stops being relevant, its channel closes and the client destroys its
  copy (level-placed actors may instead remain and just stop updating). When it becomes
  relevant again it is re-created with current replicated state and OnReps fire again. Do
  not keep client-side raw pointers to other players' actors across relevancy changes.

## Bandwidth: frequency, priority, dormancy, push model

- `NetUpdateFrequency` (checks per second, default 100 for actors, low for PlayerState) and
  `MinNetUpdateFrequency` (adaptive floor). In 5.5+ use `SetNetUpdateFrequency()` /
  `SetMinNetUpdateFrequency()` - direct member access is deprecated. Lower it for things
  that rarely change (pickups: 2-10), keep pawns high.
- `NetPriority` - share of bandwidth when saturated (pawns 3.0, PlayerController 3.0, default 1.0).
- `ForceNetUpdate()` - send changes this frame for a low-frequency actor after an important change.
- Dormancy (`NetDormancy`): `DORM_Never`, `DORM_Awake`, `DORM_DormantAll`, `DORM_DormantPartial`,
  `DORM_Initial` (placed actors that do not change until touched). A dormant actor is not
  checked for changes at all. Before changing a property on a dormant actor call
  `FlushNetDormancy()`, or wake with `SetNetDormancy(DORM_Awake)`. Great for doors, chests,
  destructibles.
- Push Model: properties are only compared when you mark them dirty, cutting server CPU.
  Needs `NetCore` in Build.cs, `FDoRepLifetimeParams` with `bIsPushBased = true`, and
  `MARK_PROPERTY_DIRTY_FROM_NAME(Class, Prop, this)` at every write. Check that it is active
  with the console variable `net.IsPushModelEnabled`. Pattern in the cookbook.
- Replication Graph (plugin) for large player counts replaces per-actor relevancy with spatial
  grids - worth it only for big-world, many-player games.

## Iris

Iris is the newer replication system (opt-in). It shipped as Experimental in 5.1 and has been
moving toward Beta/production in later 5.x releases - check the release notes for the exact
status in the project's engine version before adopting it. Enabling involves the Iris
plugin, `bUseIris = true` in the Target.cs, `SetupIrisSupport(Target);` in module Build.cs
files, and `net.Iris.UseIrisReplication=1`. Most gameplay code (UPROPERTY replication,
RPCs) stays the same; custom `NetSerialize`/`NetDeltaSerialize` and some legacy features
need Iris-specific serializers. Do not switch an existing project to Iris as a side effect
of another task; propose it to the human.

## Movement replication

- `ACharacter` + `UCharacterMovementComponent` (CMC) provides client-side prediction, server
  reconciliation and smoothing for simulated proxies. Drive it with `AddMovementInput`,
  `Jump`, `Crouch` on the owning client - never set the actor location directly for
  locally controlled characters.
- Changing movement speed only on the client (sprint) or only on the server causes
  rubber-banding (corrections). Networked movement modifiers must be in the CMC's saved
  moves: subclass `FSavedMove_Character` and `FNetworkPredictionData_Client_Character`, use a
  custom compressed flag (`FLAG_Custom_0`..`3`), and apply it in `UpdateFromCompressedFlags`
  and `GetMaxSpeed`. See the cookbook. Setting `MaxWalkSpeed` from a replicated property is
  a known source of corrections under lag.
- Non-character actors: `SetReplicateMovement(true)` replicates transform + velocity
  (`ReplicatedMovement`) from server to clients without prediction. Physics objects replicate
  via physics replication settings (smoothing, not prediction).
- Root motion from montages is replicated for Characters when the montage is played through
  the CMC-aware path (and GAS `PlayMontageAndWait`).
- Mover (experimental plugin, 5.4+) is Epic's next-generation movement framework; do not use
  in production unless the human chooses to.
- Debug: `p.NetShowCorrections 1` draws server corrections.

## Replicating GAS

See `unreal-gas`. Key points: ASC `SetIsReplicated(true)`; replication mode Mixed for
players (owner must be the controller), Minimal for AI; `InitAbilityActorInfo` on server
(`PossessedBy`) and client (`OnRep_PlayerState`); PlayerState net update frequency ~100;
grant abilities on server only; attributes use `REPNOTIFY_Always` + `GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY`.

## Spawning and destroying

- Spawn replicated actors **on the server only**; they appear on clients automatically.
  Spawning on a client creates a local-only actor the server knows nothing about.
- Projectiles: spawn on the server with `bReplicates = true` and replicated movement; for
  responsiveness, optionally spawn a cosmetic local-only copy on the firing client.
- `Destroy()` on the server removes it everywhere. Set `SetLifeSpan()` for fire-and-forget.
- Subobjects (UObjects owned by an actor, e.g. inventory items): 5.1+ use the registered
  subobject list (`bReplicateUsingRegisteredSubObjectList = true`, `AddReplicatedSubObject`).
  See cookbook.

## Sessions, Online Subsystem and travel

- Direct connect (no subsystem needed): host runs `open MapName?listen`; client runs
  `open 192.168.1.10` (default port 7777). Good for development and LAN.
- Online Subsystem (OSS): `Online::GetSessionInterface(GetWorld())` or
  `IOnlineSubsystem::Get()->GetSessionInterface()`; Build.cs `OnlineSubsystem`,
  `OnlineSubsystemUtils`. Flow: `CreateSession` -> (host) `ServerTravel`/`OpenLevel ?listen`;
  client `FindSessions` -> `JoinSession` -> `GetResolvedConnectString` -> `ClientTravel`.
  Bind the `On*Complete` delegates before calling, and clear them in the callback.
- `DefaultEngine.ini` for local development with the Null subsystem:
  ```ini
  [OnlineSubsystem]
  DefaultPlatformService=Null
  ```
  Enable plugin `OnlineSubsystemNull` (on by default in most templates).
- Steam: plugins `OnlineSubsystemSteam` (and `SteamSockets` for the socket net driver),
  `DefaultPlatformService=Steam`, `[OnlineSubsystemSteam] bEnabled=true SteamDevAppId=480` for
  testing, plus the net driver definition. Steam must be running; it does not work in PIE
  (use Standalone). Follow the engine docs page "Online Subsystem Steam" for the exact ini.
- EOS: `OnlineSubsystemEOS` plugin (or the newer Online Services plugins); needs Epic Dev
  Portal product/sandbox/deployment IDs and client credentials in Project Settings.
- CommonUser plugin (`UCommonSessionSubsystem`, `UCommonUserSubsystem`) ships with the Lyra
  sample, not the engine; copy it from Lyra if the project wants its higher-level API.
- Seamless travel (`bUseSeamlessTravel = true` on the GameMode + a transition map) keeps
  connections and selected actors across map changes; PIE does not support it - test in Standalone.
  Test all session code in Standalone/packaged builds with separate processes.

## Testing in the editor (PIE)

Click-path: Play button dropdown (three dots next to Play) > Multiplayer Options:
- **Number of Players**: 2-3.
- **Net Mode**: `Play Standalone` (no networking), `Play As Listen Server` (first window is
  the host), `Play As Client` (a dedicated server runs in the background; every window is a client).
  Always test **Play As Client** - listen-server-only testing hides bugs because the host has authority.
- Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Play > Multiplayer Options: **Run Under One Process**
  (off = separate processes, more realistic), **Enable Network Emulation** with profiles
  (Average/Bad) or custom lag/loss.
- Console alternatives (`ue_console` targets the editor world; in PIE type into the game
  window console): `NetEmulation.PktLag 150`, `NetEmulation.PktLagVariance 30`,
  `NetEmulation.PktLoss 5`, `NetEmulation.Off`.
- Inspect: `stat net`, `stat game`, `log LogNet Verbose`, `p.NetShowCorrections 1`,
  Networking Insights in Unreal Insights (run with `-trace=default,net -NetTrace=1`).
- Read `ue_log` with filter `LogNet|LogNetPlayerMovement|LogRep|Error` after a session.

## Dedicated servers

- Add `Source/<Project>Server.Target.cs`:
  ```csharp
  using UnrealBuildTool;
  public class MyGameServerTarget : TargetRules
  {
      public MyGameServerTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
      {
          Type = TargetType.Server;
          DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.Latest;
          IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;
          ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyGame");
      }
  }
  ```
  Match `DefaultBuildSettings`/`IncludeOrderVersion` to the existing Game target.
- **Server targets require a source-built engine**; the Launcher (installed) engine cannot
  build them. Check `EngineAssociation` via `ue_project_info` - a GUID usually means a
  source build, a version number like `5.4` means Launcher. Tell the human if it is Launcher.
- Build: `ue_build` with `{"target": "MyGameServer", "configuration": "Development"}`;
  package with RunUAT `BuildCookRun -server -noclient -serverplatform=Linux` (or Win64).
- Run: `MyGameServer.exe /Game/Maps/Arena -log -port=7777`; connect with `open 127.0.0.1:7777`.
- Guard cosmetic-only code (`#if !UE_SERVER`, or `IsNetMode(NM_DedicatedServer)` checks) and
  never load UI, audio or heavy VFX on dedicated servers.
- Default server map: Project Settings > Maps & Modes > Server Default Map.

## Common bugs and their causes

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Works in Standalone / as host, not on clients | Logic ran only where `HasAuthority()`, or state not replicated, or OnRep not called on host |
| Server RPC never runs | Actor not owned by calling client's connection; actor not replicated; called before possession |
| Value correct on server, stale on client | Missing `DOREPLIFETIME`, missing `Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`, actor dormant, not relevant |
| OnRep not firing | Value set on client, value unchanged (use `REPNOTIFY_Always`), property not registered |
| Rubber-banding | Movement changed outside CMC saved moves; server/client speed mismatch; teleporting owned pawn on client |
| Late joiners miss state | State sent via Multicast instead of replicated property |
| Client crash on null in OnRep/BeginPlay | Referenced actor not replicated yet; check for null and handle the later OnRep |
| Disconnect "reliable buffer overflow" | Reliable RPCs in Tick or in loops |
| Duplicate actors | Spawning replicated actors on both server and client |
| UI shows wrong player | Using `GetPlayerController(0)` on a listen server/split screen instead of the owning controller |

## Verify your work

- [ ] Every replicated property registered in `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`, `Super` called.
- [ ] State changes happen on the server; clients request via Server RPC on owned actors.
- [ ] No Reliable RPC per frame; cosmetics use Unreliable Multicast or OnRep.
- [ ] `ue_build` passes; PIE **Play As Client**, 2+ players, with network emulation (Bad): behavior matches on all windows.
- [ ] Late join: change state, then join/make relevant a new client - it sees current state.
- [ ] `ue_log` filtered on `LogNet|Error` clean after the session.
- [ ] If sessions/Steam/dedicated server: tested in Standalone or packaged, and the human was told what could not be tested in PIE.
