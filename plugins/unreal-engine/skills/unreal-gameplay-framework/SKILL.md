# Gameplay Framework

Prerequisites: `unreal-fundamentals`, `unreal-cpp`. For the Blueprint side of these classes
(data-only BP subclasses, handing graph work to the human) see `unreal-blueprints`. Related:
`unreal-multiplayer` (replication, RPCs, authority), `unreal-ui-umg` (widgets, CommonUI),
`unreal-gas` (abilities, attributes, damage via Gameplay Effects), `unreal-animation`
(character Anim Blueprints), `unreal-ai` (AI controllers), `unreal-level-environment`
(World Partition level work). Deeper material:

- `reference/actor-lifecycle.md` - exact order of constructor, OnConstruction,
  PostInitializeComponents, BeginPlay, EndPlay for spawned, placed, and loaded actors and
  components; tick setup; deferred spawning. Read before writing initialization or teardown code.
- `reference/enhanced-input.md` - Input Actions, Mapping Contexts, triggers, modifiers, full C++
  binding, creating input assets via Python, rebinding. Read before touching controls.

## Who owns what

| Class | Exists on | Lifetime | Put here |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UGameInstance` | Every machine, one per game process | Whole session, survives level travel | Cross-level state, save-system access, online session glue (prefer `UGameInstanceSubsystem`s) |
| `AGameModeBase` / `AGameMode` | Server only (never on clients) | One level | Rules: which classes to spawn, spawn points, win/lose, match flow |
| `AGameStateBase` / `AGameState` | Server + replicated to all | One level | Shared match state everyone sees (score, timer, phase) |
| `APlayerController` | Server + owning client | One level (unless seamless travel) | Input handling policy, UI creation, possession, camera manager |
| `APlayerState` | Server + all clients | One level (copied on seamless travel) | Per-player public state (name, score, team) |
| `APawn` / `ACharacter` | Server + clients | Until destroyed / respawn | Physical representation, movement, per-body input actions |
| `AHUD` | Owning client | With its controller | Legacy canvas HUD; host for UMG widget creation is common |
| `APlayerCameraManager` | Owning client | With its controller | Final camera view, shakes, fades, pitch limits |

Rules of thumb:
- Data that must survive the pawn dying (score, inventory in some designs) goes on PlayerState or
  PlayerController, not the Pawn.
- Match rules go on GameMode; anything clients must display goes on GameState/PlayerState.
- `AGameMode` pairs with `AGameState`, `AGameModeBase` with `AGameStateBase`; mixing them logs
  errors. Use the `Base` versions unless you want GameMode's match states (WaitingToStart,
  InProgress, WaitingPostMatch).
- Even in single player, respect the split; it keeps the door open for multiplayer.

## Setting up a GameMode

```cpp
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    AMyGameMode();
};

AMyGameMode::AMyGameMode()
{
    DefaultPawnClass       = AMyCharacter::StaticClass();
    PlayerControllerClass  = AMyPlayerController::StaticClass();
    PlayerStateClass       = AMyPlayerState::StaticClass();
    GameStateClass         = AMyGameState::StaticClass();
    HUDClass               = AMyHUD::StaticClass();
}
```
To use Blueprint subclasses (so artists can set meshes), make a data-only `BP_MyGameMode` from
`AMyGameMode` and set the class fields there (Python: set `default_pawn_class` etc. on the CDO, see
`unreal-blueprints`). Never `ConstructorHelpers::FClassFinder` hardcoded BP paths unless the
project already does; they break on rename.

Which GameMode runs: World Settings > GameMode Override of the map, else the project default:
```ini
; Config/DefaultEngine.ini
[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]
GlobalDefaultGameMode=/Game/MyGame/Core/BP_MyGameMode.BP_MyGameMode_C
GameDefaultMap=/Game/MyGame/Maps/L_MainMenu.L_MainMenu
EditorStartupMap=/Game/MyGame/Maps/L_Test.L_Test
GameInstanceClass=/Script/MyGame.MyGameInstance
```
Editor path: Project Settings > Project > Maps & Modes. The per-map override is in the map's World
Settings (binary): set via `ue_python`:
```python
import unreal
world = unreal.get_editor_subsystem(unreal.UnrealEditorSubsystem).get_editor_world()
ws = world.get_world_settings()
with unreal.ScopedEditorTransaction("Set GameMode override"):
    ws.set_editor_property("default_game_mode", unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.load_blueprint_class("/Game/MyGame/Core/BP_MyGameMode"))
unreal.get_editor_subsystem(unreal.LevelEditorSubsystem).save_current_level()
```
Useful GameModeBase overrides: `InitGame`, `PostLogin(APlayerController*)`,
`HandleStartingNewPlayer_Implementation`, `ChoosePlayerStart_Implementation`,
`RestartPlayer(AController*)`, `Logout`. Place `APlayerStart` actors in the level for spawn points.

## Character, movement, camera

```cpp
// MyCharacter.h
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    AMyCharacter();
protected:
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Camera")
    TObjectPtr<USpringArmComponent> CameraBoom;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Camera")
    TObjectPtr<UCameraComponent> FollowCamera;
};

// MyCharacter.cpp
#include "MyCharacter.h"
#include "Camera/CameraComponent.h"
#include "Components/CapsuleComponent.h"
#include "GameFramework/CharacterMovementComponent.h"
#include "GameFramework/SpringArmComponent.h"

AMyCharacter::AMyCharacter()
{
    GetCapsuleComponent()->InitCapsuleSize(42.f, 96.f);

    // third-person: character faces movement direction, camera follows controller
    bUseControllerRotationPitch = false;
    bUseControllerRotationYaw   = false;
    bUseControllerRotationRoll  = false;
    UCharacterMovementComponent* Move = GetCharacterMovement();
    Move->bOrientRotationToMovement = true;
    Move->RotationRate   = FRotator(0.f, 500.f, 0.f);
    Move->MaxWalkSpeed   = 500.f;
    Move->JumpZVelocity  = 700.f;
    Move->AirControl     = 0.35f;

    CameraBoom = CreateDefaultSubobject<USpringArmComponent>(TEXT("CameraBoom"));
    CameraBoom->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
    CameraBoom->TargetArmLength = 400.f;
    CameraBoom->bUsePawnControlRotation = true;      // arm follows controller rotation

    FollowCamera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("FollowCamera"));
    FollowCamera->SetupAttachment(CameraBoom, USpringArmComponent::SocketName);
    FollowCamera->bUsePawnControlRotation = false;   // the arm already rotates
}
```
- First-person variant: camera attached to the capsule or mesh head socket,
  `FollowCamera->bUsePawnControlRotation = true`, `bUseControllerRotationYaw = true`,
  `bOrientRotationToMovement = false`.
- Movement input: `AddMovementInput(Direction, Scale)`; look: `AddControllerYawInput`,
  `AddControllerPitchInput`; jump: `Jump()` / `StopJumping()`; crouch needs
  `GetCharacterMovement()->GetNavAgentPropertiesRef().bCanCrouch = true` then `Crouch()`/`UnCrouch()`.
- Custom movement belongs in a `UCharacterMovementComponent` subclass
  (`AMyCharacter::AMyCharacter(const FObjectInitializer& OI) : Super(OI.SetDefaultSubobjectClass<UMyMoveComp>(ACharacter::CharacterMovementComponentName))`),
  not in Tick on the character, especially for multiplayer (prediction).
- Mesh: `GetMesh()` is the `USkeletalMeshComponent`; typical offset
  `GetMesh()->SetRelativeLocationAndRotation(FVector(0,0,-96), FRotator(0,-90,0))` so the
  mesh's feet sit at the capsule bottom and it faces +X. Asset and Anim Blueprint are set in the
  Blueprint subclass.
- Camera manager: `PlayerCameraManagerClass` on the PlayerController; pitch limits via
  `PlayerCameraManager->ViewPitchMin/ViewPitchMax`; switch view with
  `PC->SetViewTargetWithBlend(OtherActor, 0.5f)`; shakes with
  `PC->ClientStartCameraShake(UMyShake::StaticClass())` (`UCameraShakeBase` subclasses).

## Input

UE5 uses **Enhanced Input** (legacy Action/Axis mappings are deprecated since 5.1). Summary:
Input Action assets (`IA_`) describe *what* (Jump, Move as Axis2D); Input Mapping Context assets
(`IMC_`) map keys to actions with modifiers and triggers; the local player's
`UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem` holds active contexts; the pawn/controller binds actions to
functions in `SetupPlayerInputComponent`/`SetupInputComponent`.

```cpp
void AMyCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
    Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
    if (UEnhancedInputComponent* EIC = Cast<UEnhancedInputComponent>(PlayerInputComponent))
    {
        EIC->BindAction(MoveAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &AMyCharacter::Move);
        EIC->BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Started,   this, &ACharacter::Jump);
        EIC->BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Completed, this, &ACharacter::StopJumping);
    }
}
```
Adding the mapping context, the Move function, asset creation and pitfalls:
`reference/enhanced-input.md`. Module: add `"EnhancedInput"` to `.Build.cs`.

## UI and HUD

Create UMG widgets from the PlayerController (local only):
```cpp
// header: UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category="UI") TSubclassOf<UUserWidget> HUDWidgetClass;
//         UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<UUserWidget> HUDWidget;
void AMyPlayerController::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    if (IsLocalController() && HUDWidgetClass)
    {
        HUDWidget = CreateWidget<UUserWidget>(this, HUDWidgetClass);
        HUDWidget->AddToViewport();
    }
}
```
Input mode: `SetInputMode(FInputModeGameOnly())`, `FInputModeUIOnly`, `FInputModeGameAndUI`, plus
`SetShowMouseCursor(true)` for menus. Modules: `UMG`, `Slate`, `SlateCore`.

## Damage basics

The built-in damage pipeline is simple and fine for many games (GAS is the heavier
alternative; see `unreal-gas`):
```cpp
#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage(Target, 20.f, GetInstigatorController(), this, UDamageType::StaticClass());
UGameplayStatics::ApplyPointDamage(Target, 20.f, ShotDir, Hit, GetInstigatorController(), this, UDamageType::StaticClass());
UGameplayStatics::ApplyRadialDamage(this, 50.f, Origin, 300.f, UDamageType::StaticClass(), IgnoreActors, this, GetInstigatorController(), /*bDoFullDamage*/ false);

// receiver: override AActor::TakeDamage (or bind OnTakeAnyDamage)
float AMyCharacter::TakeDamage(float DamageAmount, FDamageEvent const& DamageEvent,
                               AController* EventInstigator, AActor* DamageCauser)
{
    const float Applied = Super::TakeDamage(DamageAmount, DamageEvent, EventInstigator, DamageCauser);
    Health->ApplyHealthDelta(-Applied);
    return Applied;
}
```
Apply damage on the server/authority only. The target must have `bCanBeDamaged` true (default).
Radial damage is blocked by geometry on the `ECC_Visibility` channel by default.

## Spawning

```cpp
FActorSpawnParameters Params;
Params.Owner = this;
Params.Instigator = GetInstigator();
Params.SpawnCollisionHandlingOverride = ESpawnActorCollisionHandlingMethod::AdjustIfPossibleButAlwaysSpawn;
AProjectile* P = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, SpawnTransform, Params);

// deferred: set properties before BeginPlay / construction script runs
AProjectile* D = GetWorld()->SpawnActorDeferred<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, SpawnTransform, this, GetInstigator(),
                                                             ESpawnActorCollisionHandlingMethod::AlwaysSpawn);
if (D)
{
    D->Speed = 3000.f;
    D->FinishSpawning(SpawnTransform);
}
```
- `ProjectileClass` is `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<AProjectile>` pointed at the BP.
- `SpawnActor` returns null if collision handling says don't spawn and the spot is blocked, or if
  the class is null/abstract. Always null-check.
- Blueprint equivalent: "Spawn Actor from Class", with `ExposeOnSpawn` properties as pins.
- Destroy with `Destroy()`; set `InitialLifeSpan` or `SetLifeSpan()` for auto-destroy.
- Full ordering of constructor / OnConstruction / BeginPlay: `reference/actor-lifecycle.md`.

## SaveGame

```cpp
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UMySaveGame : public USaveGame
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UPROPERTY() int32 Version = 1;
    UPROPERTY() FTransform PlayerTransform;
    UPROPERTY() TArray<FName> UnlockedLevels;
    UPROPERTY() TMap<FName, int32> Inventory;
    UPROPERTY() TSoftClassPtr<AActor> EquippedWeaponClass;   // store paths, never live object pointers
};

// save (sync)
UMySaveGame* Save = Cast<UMySaveGame>(UGameplayStatics::CreateSaveGameObject(UMySaveGame::StaticClass()));
Save->PlayerTransform = Pawn->GetActorTransform();
const bool bOk = UGameplayStatics::SaveGameToSlot(Save, TEXT("Slot0"), /*UserIndex*/ 0);

// load (sync)
if (UGameplayStatics::DoesSaveGameExist(TEXT("Slot0"), 0))
{
    if (UMySaveGame* Loaded = Cast<UMySaveGame>(UGameplayStatics::LoadGameFromSlot(TEXT("Slot0"), 0))) { ... }
}

// async (preferred during gameplay; callback on the game thread)
FAsyncSaveGameToSlotDelegate Saved;
Saved.BindUObject(this, &UMySaveSubsystem::OnSaved);   // void OnSaved(const FString& Slot, const int32 UserIndex, bool bSuccess)
UGameplayStatics::AsyncSaveGameToSlot(Save, TEXT("Slot0"), 0, Saved);

FAsyncLoadGameFromSlotDelegate LoadedDel;
LoadedDel.BindUObject(this, &UMySaveSubsystem::OnLoaded); // void OnLoaded(const FString& Slot, const int32 UserIndex, USaveGame* Data)
UGameplayStatics::AsyncLoadGameFromSlot(TEXT("Slot0"), 0, LoadedDel);
```
- Only `UPROPERTY` members are saved. Actor/component pointers are not meaningful across runs:
  save identifiers (FName ids, soft paths, transforms) and rebuild.
- Include a version field and handle old versions on load.
- Files land in `Saved/SaveGames/<Slot>.sav` in editor/PIE on desktop.
- Put save/load orchestration in a `UGameInstanceSubsystem`.
- To save arbitrary actor state, mark fields `UPROPERTY(SaveGame)` and serialize with an
  `FObjectAndNameAsStringProxyArchive` whose `ArIsSaveGame = true` into a `TArray<uint8>`.

## Level travel and streaming

- `UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(this, FName("L_Level2"))` (short name or full path
  `/Game/Maps/L_Level2`), or `OpenLevelBySoftObjectPtr(this, LevelSoftPtr)` with a
  `TSoftObjectPtr<UWorld>` property (rename-safe). This is a hard travel: every actor, including
  GameMode, PlayerController and Pawn, is destroyed; only `UGameInstance` (and its subsystems)
  persist. Options (appended after `?`): `OpenLevel(this, Name, true, TEXT("listen"))` to host.
- Multiplayer: server calls `GetWorld()->ServerTravel(TEXT("/Game/Maps/L_Arena?listen"))`. With
  `bUseSeamlessTravel = true` on the GameMode, clients stay connected through a transition map
  (`TransitionMap=` in `[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]`). Seamless travel keeps
  PlayerControllers and PlayerStates (`APlayerState::CopyProperties` carries data), plus actors
  added in `GetSeamlessTravelActorList`. Seamless travel has historically not been supported in
  PIE; test it in a Standalone Game or packaged build.
- Level streaming (non World Partition maps): sublevels in the Levels window, loaded with
  `UGameplayStatics::LoadStreamLevel(this, LevelName, bMakeVisibleAfterLoad, bShouldBlockOnLoad, LatentInfo)`
  / `UnloadStreamLevel`, `LoadStreamLevelBySoftObjectPtr`, streaming volumes, or dynamically
  with `ULevelStreamingDynamic::LoadLevelInstance`.
- Add every map you travel to in packaged builds to Project Settings > Packaging > "List of maps
  to include in a packaged build" (or they may not be cooked).

## World Partition awareness

New open-world maps (and the UE5 Open World template) use World Partition:
- The map is a grid of streaming cells; actors load around **streaming sources** (players by
  default). An actor far from the player is simply not in the world: `GetAllActorsOfClass`,
  `ue_level_actors` and editor scripts only see loaded actors. Actors that must always exist:
  uncheck "Is Spatially Loaded" (`bIsSpatiallyLoaded`) in their Details, or put them in an
  always-loaded Data Layer.
- One File Per Actor: each placed actor is its own `.uasset` under
  `Content/__ExternalActors__/<map path>/`. Placing/moving actors changes those files, not the
  `.umap`; report them to the human (source control shows them as hashed file names).
- No sublevels: use **Data Layers** (5.1+: Data Layer Assets + instances) to toggle groups of
  actors at runtime, and **Level Instances** / Packed Level Actors for reusable chunks.
- In the editor, regions must be loaded (World Partition window > select cells > Load Region
  From Selection) before their actors can be edited by script or hand.
- HLODs are built via Build > Build HLODs (or the `WorldPartitionBuilderCommandlet`); stale HLODs
  are a visual issue, not a gameplay one.
- Detect: `World->GetWorldPartition() != nullptr` in C++, or World Settings > Enable World
  Partition in the editor.

## Common pitfalls

- Accessing GameMode on a client (`GetAuthGameMode()` returns null there).
- Adding the mapping context before the pawn has a local player / controller (see
  `reference/enhanced-input.md`).
- Camera flips or doesn't rotate: wrong combination of `bUsePawnControlRotation`,
  `bUseControllerRotationYaw`, `bOrientRotationToMovement`.
- Storing `AActor*` in SaveGame.
- Using `OpenLevel` and expecting PlayerState/Pawn data to survive.
- Spawning in the constructor or `OnConstruction` (runs in editor, spawns stray actors). Spawn in
  `BeginPlay` or later.
- Pawn not possessed: `AutoPossessPlayer` on a placed pawn, or GameMode `DefaultPawnClass` plus a
  `PlayerStart`.

## Verify your work

- [ ] `ue_build` passes; GameMode/controller/pawn classes are set in config or World Settings.
- [ ] PIE run (human, or `ue_console` commands where appropriate): the correct pawn spawns and is
      possessed; `ue_log` shows no `Accessed None`, `Error` or failed ensures.
- [ ] Input: every IA is in an IMC that is added for the local player; bindings fire (temporary
      `UE_LOG` in the handler).
- [ ] Save/load round-trips (write, restart PIE, read) and handles a missing slot.
- [ ] Maps used by travel are in the packaging map list.
- [ ] Changed binary assets (BPs, maps, external actors) saved and listed for the human.
