# Unreal Performance

Measure, find the bound, fix the biggest cost, measure again. Never optimize from a guess.
Console commands referenced here are listed in `reference/console-commands.md` - read it
when you need an exact command or cvar; do not invent cvars.

## 1. Budgets

| Target | Frame budget |
|---|---|
| 30 FPS | 33.3 ms |
| 60 FPS | 16.6 ms |
| 90 FPS (VR) | 11.1 ms |
| 120 FPS | 8.3 ms |

Game thread, render thread (Draw) and GPU run in parallel, pipelined across frames. The
frame time is roughly the **maximum** of them, not the sum. Aim for ~10-15% headroom below
the budget on the target hardware. Budget sub-systems explicitly when the project is
serious (e.g. at 60 FPS: gameplay 4 ms, animation 2 ms, physics 1.5 ms, UI 1 ms on the game
thread; lighting/shadows/post budgets on GPU) and write them in the project docs.

## 2. Measure correctly

- Profile a **packaged Development or Test build**, or at least Standalone Game
  (`UnrealEditor <Project>.uproject -game`), on target-class hardware. Editor viewport numbers
  include editor overhead; Shipping strips stats and most trace scopes.
- Disable caps while measuring: `t.MaxFPS 0`, `r.VSync 0`. Fix the resolution
  (`r.ScreenPercentage 100` or a known upscaler setting) so runs are comparable.
- Use a repeatable scenario: a fixed camera path (Sequencer), a saved game, or a
  `-ExecCmds` script. Record the same scene before and after every change.
- Warm up: the first seconds include shader compilation (PSO) and streaming hitches. Look
  at steady state separately from hitches.

With the editor live you can run commands through `ue_console`, e.g.
`{"command": "stat unit"}`; results are on screen for the human, while logged output
(`stat dumpframe`-style dumps, `memreport`) goes to `ue_log` or `Saved/Profiling`.

## 3. Find the bound

`stat unit` shows **Frame**, **Game** (game thread), **Draw** (render thread), **RHIT**
(RHI thread, when present), **GPU** and memory. `stat unitgraph` plots them over time.

| Largest | Bound | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| Game | CPU game thread | `stat game`, Insights CPU track, tick audit (section 5) |
| Draw / RHIT | Render thread (draw calls, visibility) | `stat scenerendering`, `stat initviews`, `stat rhi`, instancing (section 8) |
| GPU | GPU | `stat gpu`, `ProfileGPU`, view modes (section 7) |
| Frame high but all low | Waiting / vsync / frame cap / hitches | check `t.MaxFPS`, `r.VSync`, `stat unitgraph` spikes |

Quick GPU-bound test: `r.ScreenPercentage 50`. If frame time drops a lot, you are
pixel/GPU bound (post, lighting, overdraw); if not, look at the CPU or at vertex/geometry cost.

## 4. Unreal Insights (the main profiler)

Traces capture CPU scopes on every thread, GPU passes, frames, bookmarks, logs, loading and memory.

- Launch with tracing: `<Game or UnrealEditor> <Project>.uproject -game -trace=default`
  (default = cpu, gpu, frame, log, bookmark, and more). Add channels:
  `-trace=default,memory` (memory allocations; must be enabled at startup),
  `-trace=default,loadtime,file` (loading), `-trace=default,task` (task graph),
  `-statnamedevents` (turns stat scopes into named trace events; adds overhead).
- Write to a file instead of a live Insights session: `-tracefile=<path>.utrace` (5.x).
- At runtime (5.x): `Trace.Start default`, `Trace.Stop`, `Trace.Bookmark <name>`;
  `Trace.File` / `Trace.Send <host>` in versions that have them. Check with `help` in the
  console if unsure.
- Open `Engine/Binaries/<Platform>/UnrealInsights(.exe)`; live sessions and stored traces
  appear in the session browser. Timing Insights: frames, per-thread timelines, the
  Timers table (inclusive/exclusive time per scope), the Counters panel. Memory Insights:
  allocations by tag and callstack. Loading Insights: package load timings.

Add your own scopes in C++ so Insights shows game code by name:
```cpp
#include "ProfilingDebugging/CpuProfilerTrace.h"

void UInventoryComponent::RebuildCache()
{
    TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE(UInventoryComponent::RebuildCache);
    for (const FItem& Item : Items)
    {
        TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE_STR("Inventory.ItemPass");
        // ...
    }
}
```
For `stat` groups (shown by `stat MyGame`):
```cpp
DECLARE_STATS_GROUP(TEXT("MyGame"), STATGROUP_MyGame, STATCAT_Advanced);
DECLARE_CYCLE_STAT(TEXT("AI Perception Update"), STAT_MyGame_Perception, STATGROUP_MyGame);

void UMyPerception::Update()
{
    SCOPE_CYCLE_COUNTER(STAT_MyGame_Perception);
    // ...
}
```
Use `QUICK_SCOPE_CYCLE_COUNTER(STAT_MyGame_Thing)` for a one-off scope. Mark phases with
`TRACE_BOOKMARK(TEXT("BossFightStart"))` so they are easy to find in the timeline.

## 5. CPU: game thread

Ticks are the most common cost. Audit them:
- `dumpticks` prints every registered tick function (and whether it is enabled) to the log.
- Default to **no tick**. Turn it on only when something must run every frame:
```cpp
AMyPickup::AMyPickup()
{
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false;          // no tick function at all
}

AMyTurret::AMyTurret()
{
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
    PrimaryActorTick.bStartWithTickEnabled = false; // enable when a target is in range
    PrimaryActorTick.TickInterval = 0.1f;           // 10 Hz is enough for aiming logic
    PrimaryActorTick.TickGroup = TG_PrePhysics;
}
// later: SetActorTickEnabled(true); SetActorTickInterval(0.2f);
```
  Components use `PrimaryComponentTick` the same way. Blueprint actors: Class Defaults >
  Actor Tick > Start with Tick Enabled off, or Tick Interval.
- Replace polling with events: timers (`GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer`), delegates,
  overlap events, gameplay messages. A timer at 0.25 s beats a tick that checks a condition.
- Tick groups: `TG_PrePhysics` (default; input/movement), `TG_DuringPhysics`,
  `TG_PostPhysics` (needs final physics transforms), `TG_PostUpdateWork` (cameras, late UI).
  Use `AddTickPrerequisiteActor/Component` for ordering instead of hacks.
- Blueprint cost: heavy loops, `Get All Actors Of Class` every frame, string building and
  per-frame casting in Blueprint graphs. Move hot paths to C++ (`unreal-cpp`, `unreal-blueprints`).
- Animation: `USkeletalMeshComponent::VisibilityBasedAnimTickOption =
  EVisibilityBasedAnimTickOption::OnlyTickPoseWhenRendered` for off-screen characters;
  `bEnableUpdateRateOptimizations = true` (URO) for distant ones; keep AnimBP logic in the
  thread-safe update path. `stat anim` shows the cost.
- Physics and movement: `CharacterMovementComponent` is expensive per character; reduce
  counts, simplify collision, disable `bGenerateOverlapEvents` where not needed.

**Significance manager** (plugin `SignificanceManager`, module `SignificanceManager`) scales
work by importance (distance, visibility): register objects with a significance function,
call `USignificanceManager::Update` from your game code each frame with the view
transforms, and react in the post-significance callback (change tick interval, disable
effects, lower anim rate). Check `SignificanceManager.h` in the engine for the exact
callback signatures of your version before writing the code.

**Garbage collection**: hitches in `stat unitgraph` at regular intervals and
`CollectGarbage` in Insights. Reduce UObject churn (pool instead of spawn/destroy, use
structs for data), avoid huge `TArray<UObject*>` graphs. `gc.TimeBetweenPurgingPendingKillObjects`
controls how often GC runs (default about 60 s). Incremental reachability analysis exists
as an opt-in in 5.4+ (`gc.AllowIncrementalReachability`); treat it as experimental.
Correctness first: every UObject pointer you keep must be a `UPROPERTY` (`TObjectPtr`) or
`TWeakObjectPtr`, otherwise GC frees it underneath you.

**Object pooling** for frequent spawn/destroy (projectiles, hit effects, damage numbers):
```cpp
AProjectile* UProjectilePool::Acquire(const FTransform& Xf)
{
    AProjectile* P = Free.Num() > 0 ? Free.Pop() : GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, Xf);
    P->SetActorTransform(Xf);
    P->SetActorHiddenInGame(false);
    P->SetActorEnableCollision(true);
    P->SetActorTickEnabled(true);
    P->Activate();   // your own reset function
    return P;
}
void UProjectilePool::Release(AProjectile* P)
{
    P->SetActorHiddenInGame(true);
    P->SetActorEnableCollision(false);
    P->SetActorTickEnabled(false);
    Free.Push(P);    // UPROPERTY() TArray<TObjectPtr<AProjectile>> Free;
}
```
Niagara has built-in pooling (`ENCPoolMethod` on `SpawnSystemAtLocation`).

## 6. Loading and memory

- **Hard references load everything they point to.** A Blueprint that hard-references
  every weapon mesh loads all of them with the Blueprint. Use `TSoftObjectPtr` /
  `TSoftClassPtr` for content that is optional or chosen at runtime, then load async:
```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSoftObjectPtr<UStaticMesh> HeavyMesh;

void AMyActor::LoadHeavy()
{
    FStreamableManager& SM = UAssetManager::GetStreamableManager();
    Handle = SM.RequestAsyncLoad(HeavyMesh.ToSoftObjectPath(),
        FStreamableDelegate::CreateUObject(this, &AMyActor::OnHeavyLoaded));
}
void AMyActor::OnHeavyLoaded() { MeshComp->SetStaticMesh(HeavyMesh.Get()); }
```
  (`TSharedPtr<FStreamableHandle> Handle;` keeps it loaded; module deps `Engine`.) Avoid
  `LoadSynchronous()` during gameplay: it blocks the game thread. Primary assets and
  `UAssetManager::LoadPrimaryAsset` handle bundles of content (see `unreal-build-packaging`).
- Inspect references: Content Browser > right-click asset > **Size Map** (shows total size
  pulled in) and **Reference Viewer**.
- `memreport -full` writes a report to `Saved/Profiling/MemReports/`; read it with the
  file tools. It lists memory by class (`obj list`), textures, render targets, pools.
- `stat memory`, `stat streaming`; `listtextures` lists loaded textures and sizes.
- Texture streaming: if the log or screen shows the streaming pool over budget, textures
  go blurry. Fix the content (smaller textures, correct LOD groups, no 4K on small props,
  `Never Stream` only for UI) before raising `r.Streaming.PoolSize` (MB). Set pool size per
  platform in device profiles, not globally.
- Audio, animation and meshes also dominate memory; check `memreport` sections rather than assuming textures.

## 7. GPU

- `stat gpu` gives per-pass GPU times; `ProfileGPU` (Ctrl+Shift+Comma) captures one frame
  into the GPU Visualizer with a hierarchical pass breakdown.
- View modes (viewport **View Mode** menu, or `viewmode <name>`): `shadercomplexity`,
  `quadoverdraw`, `lightcomplexity`, `lightmapdensity`, `lodcoloration`, `wireframe`,
  `unlit`. Nanite (Nanite Visualization: Overview, Triangles, Clusters, Overdraw) and Lumen
  (Lumen Overview, Surface Cache, ...) visualizations are under the viewport View Mode menu.
- Typical GPU costs and fixes:
  - **Translucency / overdraw** (particles, foliage cards, glass): fewer layers, smaller
    particles, masked instead of translucent, `quadoverdraw` to find it.
  - **Shader complexity**: long materials on large screen areas; use material quality
    switches and static switches; see `unreal-materials-vfx`.
  - **Shadows**: Virtual Shadow Maps cost scales with invalidations (moving objects,
    WPO foliage) and resolution. Disable shadow casting on small/dynamic props, limit
    shadow-casting movable lights, tune `r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectional`.
  - **Lumen**: the biggest single GPU item in most UE5 scenes. Knobs: GI/Reflection quality
    via `sg.GlobalIlluminationQuality` / `sg.ReflectionQuality`; Post Process Volume Lumen
    settings (Final Gather Quality, Scene Detail, reflection quality); hardware ray tracing
    only when the target GPUs benefit. For low-end targets consider disabling Lumen in
    a scalability level and using baked lighting or SSGI. Keep walls thick enough for
    software Lumen (surface cache) to avoid light leaks.
  - **Nanite**: great for dense opaque geometry and cuts draw calls; costs are
    overdraw of many overlapping instances, masked/WPO materials (5.x supports them but
    they are slower), and very small instances. Not for translucent materials. Aggregate
    geometry (foliage) needs care; check the Nanite overdraw view.
  - **Resolution**: use an upscaler (TSR is the default AA in UE5) with `r.ScreenPercentage`
    below 100 on lower settings.

## 8. Draw calls and scene complexity (render thread)

- `stat scenerendering` shows mesh draw calls; `stat rhi` shows draw primitive calls and
  triangles; `stat initviews` shows visibility/culling cost.
- Many copies of the same mesh: use **Instanced Static Mesh** or
  **Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh** components (Foliage uses HISM), or Nanite meshes,
  which batch automatically.
```cpp
// In the constructor
Instances = CreateDefaultSubobject<UInstancedStaticMeshComponent>(TEXT("Instances"));
// At runtime / construction
for (const FTransform& T : Transforms) { Instances->AddInstance(T); } // local space by default
```
- Merge static clutter: **Tools > Merge Actors** (or Packed Level Actors for reusable
  groups). Fewer, larger actors also reduce game-thread and streaming overhead.
- Culling: set **Max Draw Distance / Desired Max Draw Distance** on small props, use
  Cull Distance Volumes, keep precomputed visibility for static indoor scenes.
- Material slots: each section on a non-Nanite mesh is a draw call; reduce slot counts.

## 9. LODs and HLOD

- Non-Nanite static meshes: generate LODs in the Static Mesh editor (LOD Settings > Number
  of LODs / LOD Group), check with `viewmode lodcoloration`. Skeletal meshes need LODs
  regardless of Nanite (5.5+ has experimental Nanite skinned meshes; do not rely on it).
- `r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale`, `r.SkeletalMeshLODBias`, `r.ForceLOD` are testing tools
  or scalability knobs, not content fixes.
- World Partition HLOD: define HLOD Layers, assign actors, then build HLODs (editor:
  **Build > Build HLODs**, or commandlet `-run=WorldPartitionBuilderCommandlet
  -Builder=WorldPartitionHLODsBuilder`; see `unreal-build-packaging` reference). HLODs replace
  distant unloaded cells with merged/simplified proxies and are essential for large worlds
  (`unreal-level-environment`).

## 10. Scalability and platforms

- Groups `sg.ViewDistanceQuality`, `sg.AntiAliasingQuality`, `sg.ShadowQuality`,
  `sg.GlobalIlluminationQuality`, `sg.ReflectionQuality`, `sg.PostProcessQuality`,
  `sg.TextureQuality`, `sg.EffectsQuality`, `sg.FoliageQuality`, `sg.ShadingQuality`
  (0 low - 3 epic, 4 cinematic). `scalability 0..3` sets all; `scalability auto` benchmarks.
- What each level means lives in `Config/DefaultScalability.ini` (overrides the engine's
  `BaseScalability.ini`):
```ini
[ShadowQuality@1]
r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectional=1.5
r.Shadow.MaxResolution=1024

[FoliageQuality@0]
foliage.DensityScale=0.4
```
  Copy a section from the engine's `Engine/Config/BaseScalability.ini` and edit it rather
  than writing a new one from memory; unspecified cvars fall back to the engine's values.
- Per-platform/per-device settings: `Config/DefaultDeviceProfiles.ini`
```ini
[Windows DeviceProfile]
+CVars=r.Streaming.PoolSize=2000
```
- Expose settings to players with `UGameUserSettings` (`SetOverallScalabilityLevel`,
  `ApplySettings`); see `unreal-ui-umg` for the settings menu.

## 11. The optimization loop

1. Define the budget and the target hardware; write them down.
2. Build a repeatable capture (packaged Development/Test build, fixed scenario).
3. Capture a baseline: `stat unit` numbers plus an Insights trace (and `ProfileGPU` if GPU bound).
4. Identify the bound and the single largest item in that bound.
5. Form one hypothesis, make one change (code, content via `unreal-editor-automation`, or
   config), rebuild.
6. Re-capture the same scenario; compare against the baseline. Keep the change only if
   the numbers moved; revert otherwise.
7. Record the result (commit message or perf log) and repeat from step 4.

Pitfalls:
- Measuring in the editor with other viewports, the Content Browser, or Live Coding active.
- Optimizing averages when players feel hitches: look at worst frames and `stat unitgraph` spikes.
- Changing several things at once: you will not know which helped.
- Turning features off globally (`r.Lumen...`, `r.Nanite 0`) instead of per scalability
  level: this hides the problem on high-end and breaks the look.
- Leaving debug cvars in `DefaultEngine.ini` `[SystemSettings]`. Review ini diffs.

## Verify your work

- [ ] Before/after numbers from the same scenario and build type are recorded.
- [ ] The bound (Game/Draw/GPU) was identified before changing anything.
- [ ] Changes compile (`ue_build`) and `ue_log` shows no new warnings (e.g. streaming pool over budget).
- [ ] Every cvar written to an ini exists (checked in `reference/console-commands.md`, the
      console's autocomplete, or `help` in the console).
- [ ] Scalability/device-profile changes were tested at each affected quality level.
- [ ] Visual quality regressions (Lumen, shadows, LOD pops) were checked by the human.
