# Unreal Build and Packaging

Terminology: **build** = compile C++ with UBT; **cook** = convert assets to a platform's
runtime format; **stage** = gather binaries + cooked content into a folder; **package/pak**
= put content into `.pak` (and IoStore `.utoc/.ucas`) containers; **archive** = copy the
staged build to an output folder. UAT's `BuildCookRun` does all of them.

Read `reference/uat-commands.md` for full command lines and flag tables (BuildCookRun,
BuildPlugin, commandlets, BuildGraph). See `unreal-fundamentals` for module/target basics,
`unreal-cpp` for code, `unreal-testing-debugging` for running tests in CI.

## 1. Targets, modules, configurations

- A **target** (`Source/<Name>.Target.cs`) is an executable: `TargetType.Game`, `Editor`,
  `Client`, `Server`, `Program`. The usual pair is `MyGame.Target.cs` and `MyGameEditor.Target.cs`.
- A **module** (`Source/<Module>/<Module>.Build.cs`) is a compilation unit (DLL in editor
  builds, statically linked in monolithic game builds). Modules are listed in the
  `.uproject` `Modules` array and added to targets via `ExtraModuleNames`.
- Configurations:

| Config | Game code | Engine code | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debug | unoptimized | unoptimized | Engine debugging; needs a source-built engine for editor targets |
| DebugGame | unoptimized | optimized | Debugging your game code (best default for debugging) |
| Development | optimized | optimized | Everyday editor and test builds; stats, console, logs |
| Test | optimized | optimized | Near-Shipping perf testing; keeps some profiling (stats, console optional) |
| Shipping | optimized | optimized | Release: no console, stats, `check()` or most logging |

  Editor targets only build Debug, DebugGame, Development. Test and Shipping are for
  Game/Client/Server targets. The launcher (installed) engine ships Development and Shipping
  engine binaries plus DebugGame for your modules; it cannot build Server targets.

Example targets (5.3+; `Latest` tracks the engine's current defaults):
```csharp
// Source/MyGame.Target.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;
public class MyGameTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyGameTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.Latest;
        IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;
        ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyGame");
    }
}
// Source/MyGameServer.Target.cs  (dedicated server; source-built engine required)
public class MyGameServerTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyGameServerTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Server;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.Latest;
        IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;
        ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyGame");
    }
}
```
Pinning a specific `BuildSettingsVersion.V4/V5` instead of `Latest` avoids surprise
warnings on engine upgrades; match whatever the project already uses.

Module rules:
```csharp
// Source/MyGame/MyGame.Build.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;
public class MyGame : ModuleRules
{
    public MyGame(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "EnhancedInput" });
        PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Slate", "SlateCore", "UMG" });
        if (Target.bBuildEditor)
        {
            PrivateDependencyModuleNames.Add("UnrealEd"); // editor-only code, guarded by WITH_EDITOR
        }
    }
}
```
Public dependencies: types used in your **public headers**. Private: used only in `.cpp`
files or private headers. Never make a runtime module depend on `UnrealEd` unconditionally:
the game target will fail to build/package. Put editor code in a separate `Editor` module.

## 2. Building

Prefer the `ue_build` MCP tool: `{"target": "MyGameEditor", "configuration": "Development"}`
(defaults: `<Project>Editor`, host platform, Development). It returns the output tail with errors.
The editor must be closed while compiling editor modules, or the human uses **Live Coding**
(Ctrl+Alt+F11 in the editor). With Live Coding active, a UBT build fails with "Unable to build
while Live Coding is active"; ask the human to close the editor or compile with Live Coding.
Live Coding handles function bodies well; header/layout changes (new `UPROPERTY`, new
`UCLASS`, changed constructors) need an editor restart and a full build.

Engine script locations (`<Engine>` = the engine root containing `Engine/`):

| OS | Build | UAT | Project files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | `<Engine>\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat` | `<Engine>\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\RunUAT.bat` | `<Engine>\GenerateProjectFiles.bat` (source engine) |
| Linux | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/Build.sh` | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh` | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/GenerateProjectFiles.sh` |
| Mac | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Mac/Build.sh` | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh` | `<Engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Mac/GenerateProjectFiles.sh` |

Manual build:
```
Build.bat MyGameEditor Win64 Development -Project="D:\Proj\MyGame\MyGame.uproject" -WaitMutex
./Build.sh MyGameEditor Linux Development -Project="/home/me/MyGame/MyGame.uproject" -WaitMutex
```
Find the engine for a project: `EngineAssociation` in the `.uproject` (`ue_project_info`
reports it). A version string (`"5.4"`) means an installed launcher engine; a GUID means
a source build registered on that machine.

Useful UBT flags: `-DisableUnity` (catch missing includes hidden by unity builds),
`-NoHotReloadFromIDE`, `-Clean` (clean the target), `-verbose`.

## 3. Project files

IDE project files are generated, never committed (`*.sln`, `.vs/`, `Intermediate/ProjectFiles`).
- Windows: right-click the `.uproject` > **Generate Visual Studio project files**.
- Any OS, installed engine: `Build.bat -projectfiles -project="<abs>.uproject" -game -rocket -progress`
  (Linux/Mac: the platform `Build.sh` with the same arguments). Formats: `-vscode`,
  `-CMakefile`, `-Makefile` (the Mac script generates Xcode projects by default).
- Source engine: `GenerateProjectFiles.bat -project="<abs>.uproject" -game -engine`
  (`-engine` includes engine source in the solution).
- Rider opens the `.uproject` directly. Regenerate after adding/removing source files or modules.

## 4. Packaging

**Editor**: Platforms > (platform) > **Package Project** (choose the configuration in the
same menu). Advanced: **Tools > Project Launcher** (custom profiles for cook-by-the-book,
DLC, deploy-and-launch to devices; its layout differs between 5.x versions).

**Command line** (what CI runs):
```
RunUAT.bat BuildCookRun -project="D:\Proj\MyGame\MyGame.uproject" -noP4 ^
  -platform=Win64 -clientconfig=Shipping ^
  -build -cook -stage -pak -iostore -archive -archivedirectory="D:\Out" ^
  -prereqs -nodebuginfo -unattended -utf8output
```
Output: staged at `Saved/StagedBuilds/<CookPlatform>/` (e.g. `Windows`, `Linux`), archived
at `<archivedirectory>/<CookPlatform>/`. Add `-distribution` for store builds, `-compressed`
to compress pak content, `-map=/Game/Maps/Main+/Game/Maps/Menu` to limit cooked maps,
`-skipcook` / `-skipbuild` to reuse previous steps. Full flag table in the reference.

Packaging settings (Project Settings > Project > Packaging, saved in `Config/DefaultGame.ini`
under `[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]`):
```ini
[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]
BuildConfiguration=PPBC_Shipping
UsePakFile=True
bUseIoStore=True
bCompressed=True
ForDistribution=False
IncludePrerequisites=True
+MapsToCook=(FilePath="/Game/Maps/MainMenu")
+MapsToCook=(FilePath="/Game/Maps/Level01")
+DirectoriesToAlwaysCook=(Path="/Game/Data")
+DirectoriesToAlwaysStageAsUFS=(Path="Movies")
```
Change these through the settings UI when possible and review the ini diff; field names
vary slightly across versions.

**What gets cooked**: maps in *List of maps to include in a packaged build* (all project maps if the list is empty),
the startup/default maps (`[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]` `GameDefaultMap` in
`DefaultEngine.ini`), everything they hard- or soft-reference through `FSoftObjectPath`/
`TSoftObjectPtr` properties, *Additional Asset Directories to Cook*, and primary assets per
the Asset Manager. Assets loaded only by **string path built at runtime** are not
discovered and will be missing in the package ("Failed to load" in the packaged log).
Fix by referencing them from a property, a primary asset, or an always-cook directory.

**Asset Manager** (Project Settings > Game > Asset Manager, `DefaultGame.ini`
`[/Script/Engine.AssetManagerSettings]`): declare primary asset types to scan (e.g. your
`UPrimaryDataAsset` subclasses for items, levels, characters) with directories and cook
rules; load them with `UAssetManager::LoadPrimaryAsset`. Primary Asset Labels assign
assets to chunks for DLC/patching (`Generate Chunks` in Packaging).

**Pak / IoStore**: `-pak` puts content in `.pak`; `-iostore` (default for new projects)
adds `.utoc/.ucas` containers with faster loading. Keep both on for shipping.
Loose files (`-pak` off) are only for debugging.

## 5. Platform notes

- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ game development workload and a Windows
  SDK (the engine's release notes list the exact versions). Prerequisites installer via `-prereqs`.
- **Linux**: native build needs the engine's bundled clang toolchain (`Setup.sh` fetches it for
  source builds). From Windows, install the cross-compile toolchain version matching the
  engine release and set `LINUX_MULTIARCH_ROOT`; then `-platform=Linux`. Dedicated servers
  are commonly built this way (`-serverplatform=Linux`).
- **Android**: Android Studio + SDK/NDK versions from the engine docs; run
  `Engine/Extras/Android/SetupAndroid.bat` (or `.sh`); Project Settings > Platforms > Android
  (package name, SDK license acceptance). Package with `-platform=Android -cookflavor=ASTC -package`.
- **Mac / iOS**: requires Xcode on a Mac (iOS can remote-build from Windows but signing still
  needs Apple tooling). Use `-platform=Mac` / `-platform=IOS` with `-package`.
- Consoles: under NDA; platform extensions provided by the platform holder.

## 6. Dedicated server

1. Source-built engine (from GitHub). 2. Add `MyGameServer.Target.cs` (above).
3. Guard client-only code (`UE_SERVER`, `IsRunningDedicatedServer()`, `#if !UE_SERVER`).
4. Package: `BuildCookRun ... -server -serverplatform=Linux -serverconfig=Development -noclient -build -cook -stage -pak -archive`.
5. Run: `MyGameServer.exe /Game/Maps/Arena -log` (Linux: `MyGameServer.sh`). See `unreal-multiplayer`.

## 7. CI

- Run everything headless: `-unattended -nullrhi -nosplash -nopause -stdout -FullStdOutLogOutput -utf8output`
  on editor/commandlet invocations; `-unattended` and `-noP4` (unless using Perforce) on
  UAT; `-buildmachine` marks a build-farm run (stricter, no interactive prompts).
- Cache compiled shaders and derived data. A shared DDC (network share or Unreal Cloud
  DDC) is configured in `DefaultEngine.ini` under the DDC backend graph, commonly with an
  environment override `UE-SharedDataCachePath=\\server\DDC`. 5.4+ projects use Zen-based
  local caching; check the engine's `BaseEngine.ini` `[DerivedDataBackendGraph]` for your
  version before editing. Pre-fill with `-run=DerivedDataCache -fill` (reference).
- Keep `Intermediate/`, `Binaries/`, `Saved/` and DDC out of git; cache them in CI instead.
- Typical pipeline: build editor target (for cooking) -> run automation tests ->
  BuildCookRun client/server -> archive artifacts + symbols (`.pdb`/`.debug`) separately.
- Fail the pipeline on `Error:` lines in the log and on non-zero exit codes; UAT returns
  non-zero on cook errors.
- The agent session cannot build GUI platforms it lacks SDKs for; say so plainly instead of
  claiming a build passed.

## 8. Common build errors and fixes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot open include file: 'X.h'` / `fatal error: 'X.h' file not found` | Module owning X not in dependencies, or wrong include path | Add the module to `Public/PrivateDependencyModuleNames`; include paths are relative to that module's `Public/` (or `Classes/`) folder |
| `LNK2019 unresolved external symbol` (MSVC) / `undefined reference to` (clang) | Missing module dependency; class/function in another module lacks `<MODULE>_API`; function declared but never defined | Add the dependency; add `MYMODULE_API` to the class/function; implement it. For engine classes without `ENGINE_API` on a method, you cannot call it from outside the module |
| `LNK2005 already defined` | Function defined in a header without `inline`, or included `.cpp` | Move to `.cpp` or mark `inline`/`FORCEINLINE` |
| `Unrecognized type 'FFoo' - type must be a UCLASS, USTRUCT, UENUM, or global delegate` (UHT) | Reflected property/param uses a non-reflected type, or the header defining it is not visible | Make it a `USTRUCT`/`UENUM`, include the header, or remove `UPROPERTY` |
| `#include found after .generated.h file` (UHT) | `*.generated.h` not the last include | Move it to the last include line |
| UHT error on a `UPROPERTY` whose type is a UObject held by value | UObjects are always referenced by pointer | Use `TObjectPtr<UFoo>` (or `TSubclassOf`, `TSoftObjectPtr`) |
| UHT error about an invalid class/struct prefix | Name prefix does not match the base type | `A` for Actors, `U` for other UObjects, `F` for structs, `E` for enums, `I` for interfaces |
| Circular include / incomplete type errors | Headers include each other | Forward declare (`class UFoo;`) in headers, include in `.cpp`; keep `TObjectPtr<UFoo>` members with forward declarations |
| `Circular dependency` between modules | Module A and B depend on each other | Extract shared types into a third module, or invert with interfaces/delegates |
| Builds locally, fails on CI with missing includes | Unity build hid the missing include | Build with `-DisableUnity` and add the include |
| `The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version` (dialog on editor start) | Binaries stale or built for another engine | Rebuild with `ue_build` (editor closed) or click Yes to rebuild |
| `Plugin 'X' failed to load because module 'X' could not be found` | Plugin binaries missing for this engine version | Build the project (plugin in `Plugins/` compiles with it) or `RunUAT BuildPlugin` (reference); marketplace plugins need the version for your engine |
| Renamed class/struct breaks Blueprints | Serialized references use the old name | Add a CoreRedirect in `DefaultEngine.ini`: `[CoreRedirects]` `+ClassRedirects=(OldName="/Script/MyGame.OldName",NewName="/Script/MyGame.NewName")` |
| Package fails with `LogCook: Error` / `Failed to load` | Missing/broken asset reference, editor-only asset referenced at runtime | Read the cook log in `Saved/Logs` or UAT log dir; fix the reference in the editor |
| `Unable to build while Live Coding is active` | Editor open with Live Coding | Close editor or use Live Coding |

Diagnosis order: read the **first** error (later ones cascade), identify the module, check
its `Build.cs`, then includes, then `_API` exports. For more detail read the full UBT log
(its path is printed at the end of the build output) or `ue_log` for editor-side errors.

## 9. Plugin authoring

Layout:
```
Plugins/MyTools/
  MyTools.uplugin
  Source/MyToolsRuntime/{MyToolsRuntime.Build.cs, Public/, Private/}
  Source/MyToolsEditor/{MyToolsEditor.Build.cs, Public/, Private/}
  Content/            (if CanContainContent)
  Resources/Icon128.png
```
```json
{
  "FileVersion": 3,
  "Version": 1,
  "VersionName": "1.0",
  "FriendlyName": "My Tools",
  "Description": "Runtime helpers and editor tools.",
  "Category": "Gameplay",
  "CreatedBy": "Studio",
  "CanContainContent": true,
  "EnabledByDefault": false,
  "Modules": [
    { "Name": "MyToolsRuntime", "Type": "Runtime", "LoadingPhase": "Default" },
    { "Name": "MyToolsEditor",  "Type": "Editor",  "LoadingPhase": "Default" }
  ],
  "Plugins": [
    { "Name": "EnhancedInput", "Enabled": true }
  ]
}
```
- Module `Type`: `Runtime` (everywhere), `Editor` (editor only), `UncookedOnly` (editor and
  uncooked, e.g. custom Blueprint nodes), `DeveloperTool`, `RuntimeNoCommandlet`, etc.
- `LoadingPhase`: `Default` usually; `PostConfigInit`/`PreDefault` for things the game
  module needs earlier; `PostEngineInit` for editor tooling that needs the engine up.
- Each module needs `IMPLEMENT_MODULE(FDefaultModuleImpl, MyToolsRuntime)` (or a custom
  `IModuleInterface` class) in one `.cpp`.
- Enable it in the `.uproject` `Plugins` array (`{"Name": "MyTools", "Enabled": true}`)
  and add the runtime module to dependent modules' `Build.cs`.
- Restrict platforms with `"PlatformAllowList": ["Win64", "Linux"]` on a module.
- Distribute compiled: `RunUAT BuildPlugin -Plugin="<abs>/MyTools.uplugin" -Package="<abs>/Out"`.

## Verify your work

- [ ] `ue_build` succeeded for the editor target; for runtime-affecting changes also build
      the Game target (`{"target": "MyGame", "configuration": "Development"}`) so editor-only
      dependencies are caught.
- [ ] No new warnings in the changed modules; first error fixed first.
- [ ] Packaging changes: a BuildCookRun completed and the packaged log has no `Error:` lines
      and no `Failed to load` for your assets.
- [ ] `.uproject`, `.uplugin`, `*.Target.cs`, `*.Build.cs` and ini diffs are reviewed; no
      generated files (`*.sln`, `Intermediate/`, `Binaries/`) staged.
- [ ] If a platform could not be built in this session (missing SDK), the summary says so.
